Right now the test suite is fairly nonportable:

* Assumes sh has functions.  This could be fixed by replacing all functions
  with scripts that are built the first time "defs" is run

* I think some of the invocations of "test" use nonportable flags.  I
  haven't checked this.

* UID and GID info are set at configure time; probably should be done
  at runtime.

* Fix up regex handling in rediff.c

* Fix up STDC_HEADERS stuff in verify.c.  Other stuff there too
