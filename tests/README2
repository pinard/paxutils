These files are used for testing gcpio.  They are:

echo-time.c - prints the time in seconds since 1/1/70 00:00:00 GMT.
	Usage: 
	$ ./echo-time
	707152068

swapb.c - prints a file with its bytes swapped if the file has an even 
	number of bytes.  If it does not have an even number of bytes,
	swapb prints the file unchanged.
	$ cat foo
	abc
	$ ./swapb foo
	ba
	c$ cat bar
	de
	$ ./swapb bar
	de
	$

swaphw.c - prints a file with its halfwords (16 bits) swapped if the
	file has an even number of halfwords.  If it does not have an
	even number of halfwords, swaphw prints the file unchanged.
	$ cat foo
	abc
	$ ./swaphw foo
	c
	ba$ cat bar
	de
	$ ./swaphw bar
	de
	$

rediff.c - A simple 'diff'-like program that accepts regular expressions.
	$ cat foo
	abc
	def
	gHi
	$ cat foore
	[aA][bB][cC]
	d.f
	ghi
	$ ./rediff foore foo
	< ghi
	--------------------
	> gHi

	Regular expressions may only occur in the first file.  It might be
	nice if rediff printed line numbers and could recognize when lines
	were inserted or deleted.

verify.c - A program that verifies characteristics of files.  If the
	characteristics are "OK", verify is silent (unless the -verbose
	switch is used); otherwise verify prints that actual and expected
	values that don't match.

	$ verify -size 12 file		# verify that the size of `file' is
	$ verify -verbose -size 12 file	# 12.
	OK: junk size.
	$ verify -size 11 file
	file size 12 should be 11.
	$ verify -mode 0100644 file	# verify that file the file type
					# and protection mode bits for file
					# are 0100644 (octal).
	$ verify -mtime-gt 1 file	# verify that file was modified
					# after 1/1/70 00:00:01 GMT.

These are some of the basic options to verify:

	-size bytes
	-mtime seconds-since-epoch
	-mtime-gt seconds-since-epoch
	-atime seconds-since-epoch
	-atime-gt seconds-since-epoch
	-atime-lt seconds-since-epoch
	-uid user-id-number
	-gid group-id-number
	-ino inode-number
	-mode file-type-and-protection-modes
	-nlink links-to-file

Verify can also operate on a list of files.

	$ cat list			# verify that file1, file2 and file3
	file1				# are all owned by uid 706.
	file2
	file3
	$ ./verify -uid 706 < list

Verify can also compare the characteristics of a file to another
file, and print any differences:

	$ ls -l file file2
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            12 May 29 11:16 file
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            15 May  6 17:15 file2
	$ ./verify -match-file file2 -size-match -mode-match -uid-match file
	file size match 12 should be 15.

When comparing 2 files with the -match-file option, verify can also
take these options:

	-size-match
	-mtime-match
	-atime-match
	-uid-match
	-gid-match
	-ino-match
	-mode-match
	-nlink-match

When verify is comparing 2 files, the -contents-match option can be
used to compare the contents of the 2 files:

	$ ./verify -match-file file2 -contents-match file
	file lengths and contents differ at bytes 13.
	$ ./verify -match-file file -contents-match file

If the files are actually directories, instead of regular files, verify
compares their enteries (it only verifies their names, not any characteristics
of the files themselves):

	$ ls dir1 dir2
	dir1:
	a  b  c

	dir2:
	a  d
	$ ./verify -match-file dir1 -contents-match dir2
	dir2/b: missing file.
	dir2/c: missing file.
	dir2/d: extra file.

If the files are symbolic links, verify makes sure that they point
to the same file:

	$ cd dir2
	$ ln -s a b
	$ ln -s a c
	$ ln -s d f
	$ ../verify -match-file b -contents-match c
	$ ../verify -match-file f -contents-match c
	c link contents differ.

Verify can compare the characteristics of a file to a file with the same
name in another directory.

	$ ls -l file dir/file
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            12 May 29 11:16 file
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            12 May 29 11:40 dir/file
	$ ./verify -match-dir dir -size-match -mode-match -mtime-match file
	file mtime match 707152592 should be 707154016.

Finally, verify can compare the characteristics of a list of files in
the current directory and another directory:

	$ cat list
	file
	file2
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            12 May 29 11:40 dir/file
	-rw-------   1 foo      bar            26 May 29 11:42 dir/file2
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            12 May 29 11:16 file
	-rw-r--r--   1 foo      bar            26 May 29 11:43 file2
	$ ./verify -match-dir dir -mode-match -mtime-match -list < list
	file mtime match 707152592 should be 707154016.
	file2 mtime match 707154185 should be 707154132.
	file2 mode match 0100644 should be 0100600.
