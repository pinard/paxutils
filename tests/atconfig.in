# This script is part of Autotest.  I, François Pinard, the author of
# Autotest, give unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify

# You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public License when

# govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autotest.
#
# Certain portions of the Autotest source text are designed to be copied
# (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of
# Autotest.  We call these the "data" portions.  The rest of the Autotest
# source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which
# of the data portions to output in any given case.  We call these
# comments and executable code the "non-data" portions.  Autotest never
# copies any of the non-data portions into its output.
#
# This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autotest
# released by the Free Software Foundation.  When you make and
# distribute a modified version of Autotest, you may extend this special
# exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless*
# your modified version has the potential to copy into its output some
# of the text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started
# with.  (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from
# the non-data portions to the data portions.)  If your modification has
# such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception
# to the GPL from your modified version.
