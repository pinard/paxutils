1997-04-25  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Release 1.12.

	* gzip.sh, ignfail.sh: Adjust to new delayed error exit message.

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Define as preset, so preset is
	regenerated if configuration changes.

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Nevertheless include delete01.sh.
	(POSTPONED_TESTS): Adjusted.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* delete02.sh: Mention f - explicitly, do not assume it, in case
	$TAPE is defined or the default archive has been overridden.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

1997-04-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* after: Unredirect stdout and stderr before removing the files.
	If redirections are to NFS files, removing them while they are
	still opened may have strange effects, failing almost all tests.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

1997-04-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Prerelease 1.11q.

	be addressed only after 1.12 is released.

	* extract.sh: New name for direxist.sh.
	* volume.sh: New name for volcheck.sh.
