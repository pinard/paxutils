/* An hash table contains many internal entries, each holding a pointer to
   some user provided data (also called a user entry).  An entry indistinctly
   refers to both the internal entry and its associated user entry.  A user
   entry contents may be hashed by a randomisation function (the hashing
   function, or just `hasher' for short) into a number (or `slot') between 0
   and the current table size.  At each slot position in the hash table,
   starts a linked chain of entries for which the user data all hash to this
   slot.  A bucket is the collection of all entries hashing to the same slot.

   A good `hasher' function will distribute entries rather evenly in buckets.
   In the ideal case, the length of each bucket is roughly the number of
   entries divided by the table size.  Finding the slot for a data is usually
   done at constant speed by the `hasher', and the later finding of a precise
   entry is linear in time with the size of the bucket.  Consequently, a
   bigger hash table size (that is, a bigger number of buckets) is prone to
   yielding shorter buckets, *given* the `hasher' function behaves properly.

   Long buckets slow down the lookup algorithm.  One might use big hash table
   sizes in hope to reduce the average length of buckets, but this might
   become inordinate, as unused slots in the hash table take some space.  The
   best bet is to make sure you are using a good `hasher' function (beware
   that those are not that easy to write! :-), and to use a table size at
   least bigger than the actual number of entries.

   Currently, whenever the addition of an entry gets 80% of buckets to be
   non-empty, this package automatically doubles the number of buckets.  */
