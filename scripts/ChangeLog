1993-11-24  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* dump-remind: Send mail notification to the original recipients
	that the dump has been continued when that is the case.

1993-03-31  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1 (LOGFILE): Put logfile in `log' subdirectory.

1993-03-28  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* dump-remind (volno): Don't increment by one.

1993-03-25  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): Use `--block-size', not just
	`--block', which is now ambiguous.

1993-03-24  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* backup-specs (TAR): New variable.

	* level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): Get path of GNU tar from `TAR'
	variable, don't hardcode it.

1993-03-20  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* backup-specs (SLEEP_MESSAGE): put backslashes in front of nested
	double quotes.

	* level-0, level-1 (BACKUP_DIRS): Don't put in quotes.
	(LOGFILE): Use sed to construct name, not awk.

	* dump-remind (recipients): Replaced inefficient pipeline with a
	single, simple sed script.
	(volno): Deal with the possibility that VOLNO_FILE may not be
	created yet.

1993-03-19  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* backup-specs (VOLNO_FILE): Removed abusive comment by Noah.

1993-03-18  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (AUX): Include `dump-remind' in distribution.

	* backup-specs (SLEEP_MESSAGE): New variable.
	level-0, level-1: Use it instead of external `dont_touch' file.

	* level-0, level-1: Put most of the script in () and pipe
	everything from the subshell through tee -a $LOGFILE.  Since you
	really want most of the output to go to the logfile anyway, and
	since all those pipelines were preventing one from getting the
	exit status of most commands, this seems like the right idea.

	* level-0, level-1 (LOGFILE): Use YYYY-MM-DD (all numeric) format
	for log file name, since that makes the file names sortable in a
	coherent way.  Suffix should always be `level-n' where n is the
	dump level.  level-0 script was just using `-full' instead.

	* level-0, level-1 (DUMP_LEVEL): New variable.  Set to `0' or `1'
	in each script as appropriate.

	* level-0, level-1 (HOST): Renamed to `localhost' for clarity.
	(host): renamed to `remotehost' for clarity.

	* level-0, level-1 (startdate): New variable.  Use it in Subject
	line of mailed report.

	* level-0, level-1: Fixed all instances where sed is called with a
	script on the command line to use `-e' option.

	* level-0, level-1: Don't try to call logfile.sed to filter
	LOGFILE.  It's not distributed with tar and was never really used
	anyway.

	* level-0, level-1: Put quotes around most variable names (barring
	those that are known to intentionally contain text that should be
	expanded into multiple words, like `TAR_PART1').

	* level-0, level-1: Got rid of annoying trailing backslashes in awk
	scripts.  They were gratuitous.  Made them a little more readable
	by adding some whitespace.

1992-10-21  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1: put curly braces around variables for clarity.

	* backup-specs (DUMP_REMIND_SCRIPT): define it (but commented out
	so that distributed dump scripts won't use it by default).
	level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): use --info-script if
	DUMP_REMIND_SCRIPT is defined.
	dump-remind: new file (intended as an example).

1992-10-15  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1: remove $LOGFILE.tmp files before exiting.

1992-09-24  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): remove --atime-preserve
	because of a total screw.

1992-09-10  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): put --atime-preserve inside quotes.

1992-09-09  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1 (TAR_PART1): Use --atime-preserve.

1992-07-10  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0, level-1: Avoid silly Sun awk lossage.

1992-04-30  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-1: Added `$' before VOLNO_FILE in definition of TAR_PART1.
        Added line to remove $VOLNO_FILE from any previous dump before
        starting.

	* level-0, level-1: Change long options to use `--' instead of `+'
        (support for `+' will go away soon)

1991-10-17  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0: Repair damage from previous mod: stdin to rsh must
	be the terminal or tar's questions lose.

1991-08-31  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* level-0: Fixed several syntax errors associated with
	stdout/stderr redirection.
	Made sure remote host executes commands from sh where redirection
	is necessary, since root's shell might be csh in some places and
	the redirect syntax differs.

1991-07-01  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Fix a misplaced quote in level-0 and change some >& into
	2>&1.
