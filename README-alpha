A new pretest for the `pax' utilities is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/paxutils/paxutils-2.4g.tar.gz

This is alpha software.  See `README' for list and report information.

In the last pretest, some problems were induced by Solaris gettext, which
I'm not trying to support.  So, at least for the time being, I changed
the default so to prefer the included gettext.  Let's see how it goes.
A few other reported compilation problems have not been addressed yet.

The test suite now holds `cpio' and `tar' checks.  A few failing tests
have been commented out.  Your analysis (and small diffs) are welcome!
My confidence in the package is slowly raising.  If you do not use too
far-stretched options, `cpio' and `tar' might even be dependable! :-)
