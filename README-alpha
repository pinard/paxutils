A new pretest for the `pax' utilities is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/paxutils/paxutils-2.4d.tar.gz

This is pre-alpha software.  I *did* warn you! :-).  The official report
address for problems is `paxutils-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca', yet pretesters
are invited to prefer the mailing list `paxutils-forum@iro.umontreal.ca'.

The `2.4d' version was selected for this version as it is "greater" than
both the last pretest for `cpio' and the last pretest for `tar'.  The new
`pax' program is there to justify the package name: some options are missing,
and it never suffered real life yet.  You'll also find `mt' and `rmt'.

As a radical experiment in maintenance style, I will prerelease `paxutils'
more "early and often" than I used to do with `tar', without trying to
solve everything myself between pretests.  I'll rather count on your help.

This code is pretty unstable as it stands.  I've dummied `make check': do
*not* count on it (unless you reactivate it yourself in `tests/Makefile').
I suggest that we all tackle the portability of compilation to start with.
Those who want to do more are surely welcome to do so, yet you should feel a
bit like diving in the code, then providing analysis and maybe small diffs.
Bigger diffs slow us down, as papers should be signed and sent to the FSF.
