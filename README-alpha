A new pretest for the `pax' utilities is now available as:

   http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/paxutils/paxutils-2.4f.tar.gz

This is still pre-alpha software.  You are invited to use the mailing list
mailto:paxutils-forum@iro.umontreal.ca, but you could also write to me either
at mailto:paxutils-bugs@iro.umontreal.ca or mailto:pinard@iro.umontreal.ca.

The test suite holds `tar' checks and now, a few from the `cpio' series.
Many checks fail.  Your analysis of problems (and small diffs) are welcome!
