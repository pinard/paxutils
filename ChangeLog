	versions on SCO Unix 3.2v4.2, and Solaris.

	* acconfig.h: Document HAVE_UTIME_H.
	Reported by James W. McKelvey and Robert E. Brown.

	* configure.in: Instead of replacing strstr, check for it, so
	HAVE_STRSTR gets defined, then replace it explicitely if required.

1994-08-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Updated for Autoconf 2.0.

1994-08-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Replace memset, mkdir (and rmdir), rename, strstr,
	ftruncate, when not found.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi (for memset and strstr).
	Reported by Bruno Haible (for mkdir and rename).

1994-08-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Remove padding test.
	* acconfig.h: Remove PADDING_IN_TAR_HEADER.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* configure.in: While defining DEFAULT_ARCHIVE, check for a block
	device, instead of mere existence.  But is `test -b' portable?
	Test for /dev/fd0, instead of for /dev/fd.  Put rct tests last.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* configure.in: Define uid_t and gid_t if necessary.
	Reported by Jonathan I. Kamens.

	* Makefile.in (distclean-local): Delete config.cache.
	Reported by Thomas Koenig.

	* configure.in: Change malloc_dbg to dmalloc, mutatis mutandi.
	* acconfig.h: According changes.

	* configure.in: Test for broken stat macros, and for mkfifo.

	* configure.in: Check for ST_BLKSIZE and ST_BLOCKS.

1994-08-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Prerelease 1.11.3.

	* Makefile.in (dist, shar): Distribute the scripts directory.

1994-08-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <memory.h>.

1994-07-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: When --with-malloc-dbg, define WITH_MALLOC_DBG and
	add -lmalloc_dbg to LIBS.
	* acconfig.h: Document WITH_MALLOC_DBG.

	* configure.in: Try deciding DEVICE_PREFIX and DENSITY_LETTER from
	the selected DEFAULT_ARCHIVE.
	* acconfig.h: Document DEVICE_PREFIX and DENSITY_LETTER.
	Reported by Danny R. Johnston.

1994-07-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* aclocal.m4: Adapt AC_PROTOTYPES to caching.

	* Using configure as generated by a more recent Autoconf solves a
	problem of rename being rejected on HP-UX in ANSI mode, because of
	a conflicting prototype from <stdio.h>.  In this context, Autoconf
	now uses ctype.c instead for defining __stub macros.

	Schmidt, Tim Ramsey, Van Snyder and W. Phillip Moore.

1994-07-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <fcntl.h>.  Do not define BSD42, do
	not look anymore if /vmunix, /sdmach or /../../mach exist.
	* acconfig.h: Remove BSD42.

1994-07-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Add gmalloc.o to LIBOBJS, instead of AC_SUBST'ing
	MALLOC.  Check for valloc only if gmalloc.o is not being selected.
	valloc was possibly defined both in "port.h" and GNU malloc.
	* acconfig.h: Add a description for HAVE_VALLOC.
	J.T. Conklin, Nelson H.F. Beebe and Tilman Schmidt.

1994-07-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Use provided fnmatch only as a replacement.

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/io/trioctl.h>, needed for
	defining _IOW and _IOR on the Tektronix XD88.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

1994-07-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (BACKLOG): New goal, for summarizing the
	maintainance backlog.  Distribute file BACKLOG.

1994-07-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* regex.c, regex.h: Use newer versions.  This solves a few
	problems reported by users.
	Reported by Chris Hopps and John David Anglin.

1994-07-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <utime.h>.

1994-07-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in:  Substitute DEFAULT_ARCHIVE and DEFAULT_BLOCKING
	from the environment.  Check for /dev/tape first while trying to
	decide the default archive, because it is often symlinked right.
	* acconfig.h: Explain DEFAULT_ARCHIVE and DEFAULT_BLOCKING.

	* configure.in: Use AC_SET_MAKE.
	* Makefile.in: Use @SET_MAKE@.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* configure.in: Integrate the check, previously in testpad.c,
	about a needed padding field in the tar header struct.
	* acconfig.h: Explain PADDING_IN_TAR_HEADER.

1994-07-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for -linet, this library is required on
	a few systems for gettimeofday() or getservbyname().  Also, on ISC
	4.0, this avoids a broken version of rename().
	Reported by Dean Gaudet, Goeran Uddeborg, Mike Rogers and
	Peder Chr. Norgaard.

	* configure.in: Ensure -lsocket is tested after -lnsl.  This is
	required in particular for SINIX-Z, an SVR4.0 system.
	Reported by Manfred Weichel and Mark Frost.

	* configure.in: All tests reordered for clarity.

1994-07-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Use AC_TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, test for <sys/time.h>.
	This should solve the problem of multiple inclusions of <time.h>.
	Also, also check for <sys/timeb.h>, for getdate.y tests this.
	Reported by Jim Meyering, John Rouillard, Karl Berry and Rick
	Emerson.

1994-06-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: AC_CONST was already added since 1.11.2, but no
	ChangeLog entry for it, so here is one, with list of reporters.
	* AIX 3.2 RS/6000 IBM's compiler was unable to compile regex.c,
	this might be solved already through improved Autoconf tests.

	* Makefile.in: Completely replaced, lurking at the previous one.
	At the same time, solve a few minor problems reported by users.
	The most frequently reported ones pertained to a trailing \ in a
	comment, and rmt installing in /etc.
	Reported by Dean Gaudet, Gerben Wierda, James W. McKelvey,
	John L. Chmielewski, Karl Berry, Mike Rogers, Ralf Suckow and
	Richard Lloyd.

	* configure.in: Also process lib/Makefile.in and src/Makefile.in.
	Substitute CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and YFLAGS from the environment.
	Use AC_CHECKING instead of using echo explicitely.
	Use AC_HEADER_CHECK(unistd.h) instead of obsolete AC_UNISTD_H.

	* configure.in: Generate a configuration header file.  This not
	only puts less clutter in make output, but also goes around some
	compilers' limits about the number of allowed -D options.
	Reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.

	* acconfig.h: New file.

	* Split distribution into a few subdirectories, for easing
	maintainance.  So far: src, lib, scripts, msdos which are to be
	distributed; then rmail, texinfo, ARCH and misc to be kept here.
	* scripts/ChangeLog: Initialized by moving entries related to
	scripts out of this ChangeLog.

	* Taking over maintenance duties.
