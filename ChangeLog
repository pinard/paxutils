1994-09-14  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	because NS32016 running SysVr2.2 has mkdir and lacks rmdir.
	Reported by Greg Black.

	* configure.in: Do not try anymore to discover the archive device
	by looking around for various device names.  If the installer does

	Reported by Andreas Schwab and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

1994-08-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* acconfig.h: Document HAVE_RTAPELIB and REMOTE_SHELL.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

1994-08-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Undo the `test -b' patch of 1994-08-05.  Ultrix
	4.2 test does not know about -b.  Grrr...
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/gentape.h>, HAVE_SYS_GENTAPE_H
	is tested in rmt.c.  Check for <sys/tape.h>, to avoid playing
	with M_UNIX anymore in rmt.c.
	Reported by Daniel R. Guilderson and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* configure.in: Use proper function names in AC_CHECK_LIB's.
	Reported by Alexander Dupuy and Kurt Jaeger.

	* configure.in: Use $LIBOBJS, not LIBOJBS, while adding to it.

	Reported by Bruno Haible.

1994-08-13  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <sys/wait.h>.

1994-08-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: For <utime.h>, also ensure struct utimbuf is
	defined by the header file before defining HAVE_UTIME_H.  Some
	systems will not define the structure without _POSIX_SOURCE.
	* acconfig.h: Document HAVE_UTIME_H.
	Reported by James W. McKelvey and Robert E. Brown.

	* configure.in: Instead of replacing strstr, check for it, so
	HAVE_STRSTR gets defined, then replace it explicitely if required.

1994-08-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Updated for Autoconf 2.0.

1994-08-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Remove padding test.
	* acconfig.h: Remove PADDING_IN_TAR_HEADER.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* configure.in: While defining DEFAULT_ARCHIVE, check for a block
	device, instead of mere existence.  But is `test -b' portable?
	Test for /dev/fd0, instead of for /dev/fd.  Put rct tests last.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* configure.in: Define uid_t and gid_t if necessary.
	Reported by Jonathan I. Kamens.

	* Makefile.in (distclean-local): Delete config.cache.
	Reported by Thomas Koenig.

	* configure.in: Change malloc_dbg to dmalloc, mutatis mutandi.
	* acconfig.h: According changes.

	* configure.in: Test for broken stat macros, and for mkfifo.

	Reported by Danny R. Johnston.

1994-07-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* aclocal.m4: Adapt AC_PROTOTYPES to caching.

	* Using configure as generated by a more recent Autoconf solves a
	problem of rename being rejected on HP-UX in ANSI mode, because of
	a conflicting prototype from <stdio.h>.  In this context, Autoconf
	now uses ctype.c instead for defining __stub macros.
	Reported by Alan Modra, Burkhard Plache, Edward Welbourne,
	Henrik Bakman, Jeffrey Goldberg, Jim Farrell, Kimmy Posey,
	Michael Maass, Mike Nolan, Richard Lloyd, Robert McGraw,

	Schmidt, Tim Ramsey, Van Snyder and W. Phillip Moore.

1994-07-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <fcntl.h>.  Do not define BSD42, do
	not look anymore if /vmunix, /sdmach or /../../mach exist.
	* acconfig.h: Remove BSD42.

1994-07-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Add gmalloc.o to LIBOBJS, instead of AC_SUBST'ing
	MALLOC.  Check for valloc only if gmalloc.o is not being selected.
	valloc was possibly defined both in "port.h" and GNU malloc.
	* acconfig.h: Add a description for HAVE_VALLOC.
	J.T. Conklin, Nelson H.F. Beebe and Tilman Schmidt.

1994-07-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Use provided fnmatch only as a replacement.

	maintainance backlog.  Distribute file BACKLOG.

1994-07-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	problems reported by users.
	Reported by Chris Hopps and John David Anglin.

1994-07-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for <utime.h>.

1994-07-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in:  Substitute DEFAULT_ARCHIVE and DEFAULT_BLOCKING
	from the environment.  Check for /dev/tape first while trying to
	decide the default archive, because it is often symlinked right.
	* acconfig.h: Explain DEFAULT_ARCHIVE and DEFAULT_BLOCKING.

	* configure.in: Use AC_SET_MAKE.
	* Makefile.in: Use @SET_MAKE@.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	about a needed padding field in the tar header struct.
	* acconfig.h: Explain PADDING_IN_TAR_HEADER.

1994-07-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Check for -linet, this library is required on
	a few systems for gettimeofday() or getservbyname().  Also, on ISC
	4.0, this avoids a broken version of rename().
	Reported by Dean Gaudet, Goeran Uddeborg, Mike Rogers and
	Peder Chr. Norgaard.

	* configure.in: Ensure -lsocket is tested after -lnsl.  This is
	required in particular for SINIX-Z, an SVR4.0 system.
	Reported by Manfred Weichel and Mark Frost.

	* configure.in: All tests reordered for clarity.

1994-07-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: Use AC_TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, test for <sys/time.h>.
	This should solve the problem of multiple inclusions of <time.h>.
	Also, also check for <sys/timeb.h>, for getdate.y tests this.
	Reported by Jim Meyering, John Rouillard, Karl Berry and Rick
	Emerson.

1994-06-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* configure.in: AC_CONST was already added since 1.11.2, but no
	ChangeLog entry for it, so here is one, with list of reporters.
	* AIX 3.2 RS/6000 IBM's compiler was unable to compile regex.c,
	this might be solved already through improved Autoconf tests.

	Reported by Alexey Vovenko, Ben A. Mesander, Bryant
	Fujimoto, Christian. T. Dum, Christopher Vickery, Dan Bloch,

	R. Scott Butler, Rob Parry, Ron Guilmette, Scott Grosch,
	Sherwood and Stephen Saroff.

	* Makefile.in: Completely replaced, lurking at the previous one.
	At the same time, solve a few minor problems reported by users.
	The most frequently reported ones pertained to a trailing \ in a
	comment, and rmt installing in /etc.
	Reported by Dean Gaudet, Gerben Wierda, James W. McKelvey,
	John L. Chmielewski, Karl Berry, Mike Rogers, Ralf Suckow and
	Richard Lloyd.

	* configure.in: Also process lib/Makefile.in and src/Makefile.in.
	Substitute CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and YFLAGS from the environment.
	Use AC_CHECKING instead of using echo explicitely.
	Use AC_HEADER_CHECK(unistd.h) instead of obsolete AC_UNISTD_H.

	* configure.in: Generate a configuration header file.  This not
	only puts less clutter in make output, but also goes around some
	compilers' limits about the number of allowed -D options.
	Reported by Nelson H.F. Beebe.

	* acconfig.h: New file.

	* Split distribution into a few subdirectories, for easing
	maintainance.  So far: src, lib, scripts, msdos which are to be
	distributed; then rmail, texinfo, ARCH and misc to be kept here.
	* scripts/ChangeLog: Initialized by moving entries related to
	scripts out of this ChangeLog.

	* Taking over maintenance duties.
