	value is bigger than what a superdigit may hold, as this happens
	in practice.  Get rid of the negative case, currently unused.

	Eggert.

1997-06-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* reading.c (read_header): Clean up and many tiny changes.
	Accepts a tar_entry argument to modify instead of changing global
	variables, save recognised format in it.  Do more sensible
	allocation for name and linkname.  Do not loose the 100th
	character anymore, do allocate the memory for accomodating a NUL
	for long names or linknames, and probably such other tiny bugs.
	Callers changed.
	(decode_header): Clean up.  Replace three arguments by one
	tar_entry.  Do not decode format again.  Callers changed.

1997-06-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Do not limit the cache to one user and one group, use module

	* create.c (dump_file): Remove badperror label, call WARN
	explicitly at the two other needed places instead.  Remove
	badfile label, expand the proper code at the three other
	needed places instead.	Delete the critical_error flag, just

	* buffer.c, tar.c, update.c, common.h: Replace COMMAND_ prefixed
	macros by _COMMAND suffixed, COMMAND_NONE by UNKNOWN_COMMAND,

	main_command_option of this enum type, to replace command_mode,
	which was an int, everywhere.
	* tar.c (decode_options): Initialise main_command_option.
	(set_main_command_option): New function to replace
	SET_COMMAND_MODE.  Diagnostic ambiguous command as soon as seen.
	However, be forgiving if command has merely been repeated.

	* buffer.c, tar.c, common.h: Have info_script_option be at the
	same time a flag and the option value, no need for a separate
	info_script variable.  Rename rsh_command to rsh_command_option,

	* incremen.c, tar.c, common.h: Rename gnu_dumpfile to
	listed_incremental_option.  Let it unitialised for just incremental.

	preset_group to group_option and preset_mode to mode_option.

	* create.c, incremen.c, list.c, tar.c, commun.h: Have
	after_date_option be a Boolean instead of a three-valued flag.
	Rename threshold_time to newer_mdate_option, which may be looked
	at without checking after_date_option first, as threshold_time
	before.  Make newer_cdate_option an alias for newer_mdate_option.

1997-04-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	--ignore-failed-read.
	Reported by Ralph Schleicher.

	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): Chain the last partial zero block
	with the preceding data, do not try sparing it.  This correction
	is approximative, as the whole thing should be rethought.
	Reported by Andreas Degert.

1997-03-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* All: Rename head to current_header, hstat to current_stat, and

	* update.c (update_archive): Rename nstat to stat_data.

1997-03-21  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* names.c (name_gather): Do not declare static variables which
	do not need to be.  Have allocated_length represent the full
	allocated length, instead of only the name part.  It's clearer.
	(addname): Similar cleanups.

1997-03-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* compare.c: Always call report_difference when there is a
	problem, so the exit status will be set in all cases.  Build the
	message string if necessary, so avoiding stdargs/varargs.
	(report_difference): If NULL argument, just set the exit status
	without reporting a message.  Move out the word `differs'
	in all callers, do not insert into an English message.
	(read_and_process): Return void, as the int result is never used.
	Assume processors returns nonzero for success and zero for
	failure, instead of 0 for success and -1 for error.
	(process_rawdata, process_dumpdir): Adjusted.

	* compare.c: Remove different as a global variable, it is useless.
	(diff_sparse_files): Make different a local variable, reinitialise
	it on each call.  Otherwise, after any error elsewhere, all sparse
	files were always and falsely reported as erroneous.
	Reported by James E. Carpenter and Tim Towers.

	whenever checksums do not match.
	Reported by Marc Boucher and Marty Leisner.

	modified files in old directories were not dumped, that is, if a
	directory was older than the listed entry, it was skipped
	completely without checking the contained files.
	Reported by David Johnson, John David Anglin and Wolfram Wagner.

	* buffer.c (open_archive): When updating the archive, initialize
	the access variable with reading mode, not update mode.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* delete.c (junk_archive): Initially jump directly into the loop,
	so deleting a file after a big one will not destroying the archive.
	Reported by Akiko Matsushita, Andreas Schwab, Eric Backus, Jeff
	Siegel, Saul Lubkin, Stuart Kemp and Yasushi Suzudo.

1996-11-10  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* all: Add a FIXME comment everywhere errno is modified by tar.

	* buffer.c (new_volume): Return nonzero/zero for success/failure,

	apparently useless allocation of one extra byte.  Avoid using p.

	* buffer.c: Add DEBUG_FORK conditional code.
	Reported by Thomas König and Ulrich Drepper.

	* misc.c (maybe_backup_file): In the renaming message, say that
	the previous file is being renamed, not the newly extracted one.

	* extract.c (set_stat): Until we know better, for the time being,
	limit restoring symbolic link attributes to lchown only.

	* all: Mini clean up.  Systematically set logical variables to
	one instead of auto-incrementing them (PDP-11 time is over by
	now! :-).  Replace some single letter counters or cursors by

	* buffer.c: Have real_s_name able to hold PATH_MAX characters,

	file, dumping incremental which should not have been, etc.

	cursor instead.  Also avoid the optimization of cleaning each
	save_name only once per flush_read if it did not change: it
	was using `save_name = real_s_name;', and since save_name may
	be freed at any time, this is/was really running after trouble.

	GNU_FORMAT, and --posix with POSIXLY_CORRECT yields POSIX_FORMAT.
	* create.c (start_header): Use TMAGIC and TVERSION if required.
	Replace all flag_old_archive and flag_standard appropriately.

	* tar.c: Implement a --record-size option, which is an
	alternate way of saying --blocking-factor, in bytes this time.

	* tar.h, tar.c, create.c (dump_file): Implement
	a --no-recurse option, to help using tar with find.
	Reported by Chris G. Demetriou, Jamie Zawinski, Kimball
	Collins, Loic Dachary, Oswald P. Backus IV and Stuart Poulin.

	* tar.h, tar.c, buffer.c (child_open_for_compress):
	Delete --block-compress, issue a warning if used.  It was never
	obeyed while outputting on disk files, where it would have been
	useful.  It was only obeyed for pipes, remotes and devices, that
	is, exactly when it would be an error not to specify it.

	Reported by Hans Guerth, James H Caldwell Jr, Jean-loup Gailly,
	Jeffrey W. Parker, John D. Sybalsky, Kai Schlichting, Marcin
	Matuszewski, Mike Silano, Paul O'Connor, Pete Geenhuizen and
	Richard Stallman.

	* buffer.c (open_archive): Cosmetic changes.

	* buffer.c, diffarch.c, tar.h, update.c: Rename fl_read by
	flush_read and fl_write by flush_write.

1995-06-27  John Oleynick  <juo@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

        * configure.in: fixed for new autoconf.  Added check to make
	sure fnmatch() works.
        * Makefile.in: changed realclean to maintainer-clean.  Added
	support to handle fnmatch separate from other LIBOBJS.
        * cpio.texi:  More changes for 2.4.

1995-06-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (usage): Remind that `USER@' may be specified.
	Reported by John J. Szetela and Oliver Trepte.

	* tar.c (usage): Replace `modificators' by `modifiers'.
	Reported by Alan Modra.

	* extract.c (set_mode, set_stat): New functions, from
	previous code, elsewhere.  Replace various occurrences of code
	appropriately with function calls.  Ensure mode bits are properly
	set in all circumstances.  This may imply calling set_mode twice.
	Reported by Piercarlo Grandi and Tim Magill.

	* extract.c: Save the whole stat information in saved
	directory information, instead of parts of it, all mistyped.
	(restore_saved_dir_info): Free information as we consume it.
	Simplify code by using set_mode and set_times.  Rename routine to
	apply_delayed_set_stat, and do some other cleanup around it.

	* *.[hc]: Replace flag_confirm by flag_interactive,
	flag_do_chown by flag_same_owner,
	flag_exstdout by flag_to_stdout,
	flag_follow_links by flag_dereference,
	flag_gnudump by flag_incremental,

	flag_volhdr by volume_label,
	flag_compressprog by compress_program,
	flag_rsh_command by rsh_command,
	and flag_volno_file by volno_file.

	* tar.c: Rename --modification-time by --touch, and provide a
	warning for the old option.

1995-06-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* list.c (decode_header): At extraction time, use the stored
	uid if uname is unknown in this system, and use the stored gid if
	gname is unknown in this system, instead.  This solves a long
	lasting bug by which restored files were all owned by root, using
	an incomplete /etc/passwd or /etc/group file.
	* names.c: Rename finduname to uid_to_uname and findgname to
	gid_to_gname, exchanging the order of arguments.  Use uid_t and
	gid_t instead of int's.  Use empty strings in cached_[ug]name for
	marking there is no valid cached translation, instead of using
	magic values for cached_[ug]id.  Rename finduid to uname_to_uid
	and findgid to gname_to_gid, adding a second argument to store the
	result if found, and returning a success/failure indication, not
	anymore assuming the current [ug]id by default.
	* tar.h, create.c, list.c: Adjust prototypes and callers.

	Reported by Anders Andersson, Bernard Derval, Brian Perkins,
	Charles Fu, Daniel Trinkle, Ian Jackson, Johannes Helander,
	Michael Lin, Richard Sims, Robert E. Brown, Tim P. Starrin and
	Torkel Hasle.

	* tar.h, create.c, list.c, names.c, tar.c:
	Implement --numeric-owner, to replace the NONAMES define.  Then,
	ensure some reasonable values to magic and linkflags if POSIX.
	Reported by Benedikt Stockebrand, Ian Jackson and Stephen Gildea.

	* buffer.c: Delete save_block function, as well as
	saved_block_pointer and saved_block variables.  Blocks were
	carefully saved indeed, but never consulted after the fact.
	* tar.h: Delete save_block prototype.
	* *.c: Delete all usages of save_block.

	* rmt.c: Add static to variable declarations.
	* list.c (read_header): Rename recsum to recorded_sum.

1995-06-23  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *.[hc]: Rename --read-full-blocks to --read-full-records,
	--block-size to --blocking-factor, and --record-number to
	--block-number.
	* tar.c (decode_options): Diagnose usage of old names.

	* *.[hc]: Rename saverec to save_block, findrec to
	find_next_block, and userec to set_next_block_after.
	Replace endofrecs by available_space_after which does the space
	computation instead of returning the end pointer, adjust and
	simplify all callers, by using variable data_block systematically.
	Also, rename union block field charptr to buffer.

1995-06-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *.[hc]: Exchange "record" and "block" almost everywhere and
	whenever appropriate, to follow the terminology used in
	P1003.1-1990, and so removing a lot of confusion in sources.

	* tar.h: Prefer naming constants and fields per P1003-1.1990 as
	far as possible.  Rename those remaining LF_xxx to GNUTYPE_xxx.
	* *.c: Adjusted accordingly.

	* tar.h: Clean up the header structure.  Make very clear what is
	specified by POSIX, and what is extended format.  Use
	xxx_FIELD_SIZE instead of NAMSIZ, TUNMLEN and TGNMLEN.  Dismangle
	some other names, on the way...
	* *.c: Adjusted accordingly.

	* tar.h: Do not declare baserec, declare current_block_ordinal.
	* buffer.c (current_block_ordinal): New function.
	Rename baserec to record_start_block, and make it static.
	* list.c: Use current_block_ordinal, avoid baserec computations.
	* buffer.c, list.c: Get rid of saved_recno and annofile.

	* buffer.c, diffarch.c: Move no_op and wantbytes from
	buffer.c to diffarch.c.  Correct prototypes so first arg is long.
	* tar.h: Do not declare no_op nor wantbytes, anymore.

	* tar.h, buffer.c: Move ar_block, ar_record and ar_last
	from tar.h to buffer.c, renaming them to record_start,
	current_block, record_end respectively.
	* update.c: Add temporary extern declaration for record_start,
	current_block and record_end.

	* tar.h, buffer.c: Move ar_reading from tar.h to buffer.c,
	renaming it to reading_archive.
	* diffarch.c: Add temporary extern declaration for
	reading_archive.

	* buffer.c, create.c, diffarch.c, extract.c, gnu.c,
	list.c, names.c, rmt.c, rmt.h, rtapelib.c,
	tar.c, update.c: Replace many #ifdef's by #if's, and
	#ifndef's by #if !'s.

	* buffer.c (redirect): New name for dupto.  Callers changed.

	* create.c (dump_file), extract.c (extract_archive,
	extract_sparse_file), tar.h: Remove crumb about ending_blanks
	and end_nulls.

	* Makefile.in (all): Do not prepare genfile by default, as it
	is only needed for checking.

	* tar.c (decode_options): Diagnose lacking arguments to old
	options.
	Reported by Aage Robeck, Alan Cox, Benny Holmgren, Bruno Haible,
	Daniel Quinlan, Michael Schmidt, Richard J. Kettlewell and Robert
	Leslie.

	* tar.h: Remove external prototypes related to rtapelib.c, as
	those are already declared in rmt.h.

1995-06-18  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* buffer.c (xclose): New, from port.c (ck_close).
	Replace ck_close by xclose in all modules.
	* port.c: Remove ck_close.

	* port.c: Remove ck_malloc, because xmalloc can be used
	instead, now that it protects against malloc(0) returning NULL.
	* gnu.c (gnu_restore), list.c (read_header): Replace
	ck_malloc with xmalloc.  In gnu_restore, remove skipping code in
	case of failed allocation, because tar already aborted in xmalloc.
	* tar.h: Delete ck_malloc declaration.

	* port.c: Remove mknod, link, chown and geteuid, which
	normally exist on Unix.  To be reinserted later, as needed.
	Reported by Jyh-Shyang Wang, Nelson H. F. Beebe, Philippe Defert
	and Serge Granik.

	* tar.c: Declare TTY_NAME, moved over from port.c.

	* extract.c (extract_archive), tar.c (decode_options):
	Clean out old NO_OPEN3 code.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* buffer.c (child_open): In-line previous ck_pipe code.
	* tar.h: Delete ck_pipe declaration.
	* port.c: Delete ck_pipe function.

	* misc.c: New, reorganizing remaining code from port.c.
	* port.c: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

	* misc.c (un_quote_string): If `\' ends a string to unquote,
	just pass it undisturbed.
	From Robert Lipe.

	* system.h: Replace many #ifdef by #if, #ifndef by #if !.

1995-06-17  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Release tar 1.11.8.

	* Makefile.in (mostlyclean): Remove also _*.c and _*.o.

	* create.c (dump_file), gnu.c (get_dir_contents): Cast
	(int) explicitely for test.

	* Makefile.in ($(OBJECTS)): Depend on ../intl/libgettext.h
	instead of ../intl/libintl.h, which does not always exist.

	* genfile.c: Define EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE if not.
	* tar.c (main): Use TAREXIT_SUCCESS instead of EXIT_SUCCESS.

	* tar.h: Use off_t instead of long for the second argument in
	__rmt_lseek declaration.
	* system.h: Remove typedef of off_t, because AC_TYPE_OFF_T
	takes care of it now.
	Reported by Coranth Gryphon, Jim Blandy and Thomas Krebs.

1995-06-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* checktar.sh: Send a message saying that it is still useless.

1995-06-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h, tar.c (decode_options), extract.c
	(extract_archive), diffarch.c (diff_archive), create.c
	(dump_file, start_header), tar.c (decode_options): Replace
	flag_absolute_paths by flag_absolute_names.
	* tar.c (decode_options): Implement OBSOLETE_ABSOLUTE_NAMES for
	reporting --absolute-paths as obsolete.

	* system.h: Conditionnaly include <locale.h> and define
	setlocale to void independently of ENABLE_NLS.
	Reported by Ulrich Drepper.

1995-06-10  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (long_options): Use no_argument and require_argument,
	instead of constants.  Have long option names translated to short
	options whenever possible, rather than setting flags directly:
	easing option management is worth a few extra nanoseconds.

	* tar.c (long_options): Add --gunzip as meaning -z.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

1995-06-07  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Use subdir and distdir.

	* system.h [NLS]: Simplify by merely including <libintl.h>.
	Also, define setlocale to empty only if the setlocale function is
	not known, instead of when <locale.h> is missing.
	* Makefile.in (INCLUDES): Use ../intl in compilations,
	taking care of the fact libintl.h might have been symlinked there.

1995-06-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c, tar.h: Rename TAR_EXTERN to GLOBAL.

	* tar.h: Delete COMMAND_VERSION.
	* tar.c: Replace OPTION_HELP and OPTION_VERSION commands by
	show_help and show_version variables, so `--version --create' will
	not diagnose `Too many commands'.  Adjust things so this works.
	Reported by Marty Leisner.

1995-06-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (check): New goal.
	* checktar.sh: New script.
	* genfile.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (all): Prepare genfile.
	* Makefile.in: Distribute checktar.sh and genfile.c.

1995-06-03  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Adjust so extracted doc/header.texi is neater.

1995-05-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (name_match): Use %s for printing directory, not %d.
	Reported by Marty Leisner.

	* tar.c (name_gather, addname): chdir_name receives string
	pointers which might later be overwritten, but nevertheless saved
	into structures, so, use xstrdup for the time being.
	Reported by Michael Holmes.

	* tar.c (name_next, name_from_list): Abort when chdir fails.
	Reported by Ian Jackson and Marty Leisner.

1995-05-28  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.h: Declare second argument of __rmt_lseek to be off_t
	instead of long, so it is the same as in rmt.c.
	Reported by Chris Arthur.

	* buffer.c (close_archive): Compensate for the addition of 2
	to ar_block at open_archive time, for when -M used, just before
	calling free.
	Reported by Bruno Haible, Clinton Carr, Hernan Prieto Schmidt,
	Kevin Dalley, Loren J. Rittle and Marty Leisner.

	* rmt.c: Replace SSIZE by STRING_SIZE, avoiding a conflict
	with some header files.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi and William Bader.

	* tar.c: Use DEVICE_PREFIX instead of DEVICE_PREXIX, and
	WITH_REGEX instead of WITH_REGEC.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

1995-05-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (tar): Have $(OBJECTS) depend on system.h.

	* system.h: Many adjustements for GNU gettext.

	* Makefile.in: Clean glocale out.

1995-05-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Use libintl.a while linking.
	* system.h: Include <libintl.h> unconditionally, instead only
	if WITH_CATALOG.  Let <libintl.h> define _() appropriately.
	* tar.c (main): Call textdomain.

1995-05-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* system.h, gnu.c, list.c, port.c: Avoid
	superfluous parentheses in macro definitions.
	* port.c: Capitalize macro arguments.
	* buffer.c, create.c, diffarch.c, tar.c: Use comma
	operator when assignment in test.

1995-04-27  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* port.c (link): Use WARN to report the message.
	Reported by Sherwood Botsford.

1995-03-19  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* system.h: Use WITH_CATALOGS to define _() differently.

1995-03-14  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Close the unused side of each
	pipe, instead of the useful one, prior to processing.
	Reported by Charles Lopes and Minh Tran-Le.

1995-02-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Replace `date' by `echo timestamp'.

1995-02-19  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Support ID files.  Do not distribute TAGS.

1995-02-13  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Use top_srcdir.

1995-02-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* gnu.c (is_dot_or_dotdot): Through NFS, readdir might deliver
	empty filenames under old Solaris 2.4, causing endless loops in
	tar.  As a workaround, avoid `' as done already for `.' and `..'.
	Reported by Jan Carlson.

1995-02-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (maintainer-clean): New name for realclean.

1995-01-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* extract.c (make_dirs) [MSDOS]: Correct for Turbo C, which may
	return EACCES instead of EEXIST on mkdir.
	Reported by Jeffrey Goldberg.

	* tar.c (usage) [MSDOS]: Do not tell about -N and related.
	(decode_options) [MSDOS]: Be blind to -N and related.
	Reported by Jeffrey Goldberg.

	* rmt.h (_remdev): A filename is not remote if the colon is
	preceeded by a slash, to take care of `/:/' which is a shorthand
	for `/.../<CELL-NAME>/fs' on OSF's Distributing Computing
	Environment (DCE) and Distributed File System (DFS).
	Reported by Travis L. Priest.

1995-01-03  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (decode_options): Renamed from options.  Convert
	oldish-style non-dashed options to modern writing before
	performing option decoding.  Diagnose when modern options are met
	before old style options are fully converted.  This allows
	mixing of option styles on a single call.  Avoid getoldopt and
	use getopt_long instead.
	* getoldopt.c: Deleted.
	* tar.h: Prototype deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.
	Reported by Bruno Haible, Les Mikesell, Patrick Timmons and Saul
	Lubkin.

	* buffer.c, diffarch.c, rmt.c, rtapelib.c,
	update.c: Simplify accordingly.

	* system.h: If it exists, include <sys/ioccom.h> prior to
	<sys/mtio.h>, to account for problems when GNU libc 1.0x is
	installed over SunOS 4.1.3: GNU libc does not provide sys/mtio.h,
	so it is taken from Sun header files which use things like _IOW,
	which GNU libc despises, sys/ioccom.h then provides definitions.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco.

	the copy to be the access time of the original (instead of the
	modification time of the original).  Reported by
	karney@pppl.gov (Charles Karney).

	* cpio.texi:  Updated with changes for 2.4.

1994-12-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* buffer.c, tar.c [WITH_REGEX]: Check it.

1994-12-03  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.c: Adjust for localization, by including <locale.h> and
	<libintl.h>, by defining _(), by defining and calling setlocale,
	and by defining and initializing program_name.
	* Makefile.in: Use locale.o and libtar.a with rmt.

	* Makefile.in: Ensure INSTALL_DATA is defined.

	* Makefile.in, tar.h, tar.c:
	Localize, adapting from how it is done in sharutils.

	diffarch.c, extract.c, gnu.c, list.c,
	rtapelib.c, update.c: Rename _ to __P.
	* tar.h, rmt.h: Declare _ as a macro returning its
	argument, or else, include <libintl.h> and declare _ as gettext.
	* tar.c: Possibly include <locale.h> and call setlocale.
	* rmt.c, buffer.c, create.c, diffarch.c,
	extract.c, getoldopt.c, gnu.c, list.c,
	mangle.c, port.c, rtapelib.c, tar.c,
	update.c: Use _ macro over all localizable strings.

	* rtapelib.c: Declare prototype for xstrdup.  Do not declare
	strstr, which is not needed.

1994-11-03  John Oleynick  <juo@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* safe-stat.h, Makefile.in:  New file used by mkdir.c.  This will go
	away when we get the real safe-xstat.[ch]in for mkdir.c.

	* main.c:  Don't mention [--null] twice in -p's usage message.
	Changed --no-absolute-paths to --no-absolute-filenames.

	* cpio.1:  Updated man page with new features.

	* cpio.texi, texinfo.tex, Makefile.in:  Added texi documentation
	from Robert Carleton (rbc@gnu.ai.mit.edu).

1994-11-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Clean up, following those of GNU m4.  I will
	not detail all the changes here.
	* tar.c: Use PRODUCT and VERSION instead of version_string.

1994-10-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h [__STDC__]: Use #if instead of #ifdef.

1994-10-27  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.h, tar.h, buffer.c, create.c, diffarch.c,
	extract.c, gnu.c, list.c, mangle.c, tar.c,
	update.c: Rename all f_* variables to flag_*.

	* tar.h, buffer.c, tar.c, update.c: Rename cmd_mode into command_mode.
	* tar.c (SET_COMMAND_MODE): New macro, use it.

	* port.c (quote_copy_string): Prevent sign extension of

	Ryutaro Susukita.

1994-10-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.c, rtapelib.c, tar.h: Get rid of CONFIG_BROKETS.

1994-10-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* diffarch.c (fill_in_sparse_array): Add a cast for Pyramid's
	dumb compiler.  Later remove the cast and compare to 0 instead.
	* extract.c (extract_archive): Idem.
	Reported by Karl Vogel and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

1994-10-03  John Oleynick  <juo@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* makepath.c: Don't #define index if it is already #defined.

	* mt.c:  Check for __hpux defined instead of __hpux__.  Reported
	by ericb@lsid.hp.com (Eric Backus).

1994-09-29  John Oleynick  <juo@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extern.h, util.c, copyout.c, copypass.c, main.c, global.c:
	Never mind --ignore-disk-input-errors flag, we'll just always
	do that, like tar.

	* global.c, extern.h, main.c, copyin.c, copyout.c, copypass.c:
	Added --quiet flag to supress printing number of blocks copied.

	* global.c, extern.h:  If compiled with gcc, make input_bytes
	and output_bytes `long long' instead of `long'.  We need more
	than 32 bits to keep track of the number of bytes copied to
	and from tape drives that hold more than 4Gbytes.

	* util.c, copyin.c, main.c, global.c, extern.h:  Added
	--only-verify-crc flag to read a CRC format archive and verify
	its contents' CRCs.

	* copyout.c:  Fixed problem with creating oldc format archives
	on machines with 16 bit ints.  Reported by mpoole@cix.compulink.co.uk
	(Martin Poole).

	* mt.c: Need to open tape WR_ONLY for erase command (and probably
	others?).  Reported by robert@hst.e.technik.uni-kl.de (Robert
	Vogelgesan).  Accept `eject' as a synonym for `offline'.  Accept
	`-t' as a synonym for `-f' (to be compatible with HPUX mt, which
	only accepts `-t').

1994-09-28  John Oleynick  <juo@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extern.h, global.c, main.c, util.c: only write sparse files
	when given --sparse flag.

	* extern.h, util.c, copyout.c, copypass.c, main.c, global.c:
	Added support for --ignore-disk-input-errors flag.

1994-09-27  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* diffarch.c: Normalize capitalization in diagnostics.

1994-09-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (name_next, name_match): Abort tar if directory cannot
	be changed, instead of going on.  This is not an innocuous error.
	Reported by Marty Leisner.

1994-09-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rtapelib.c: Include "rmt.h" only once <sys/types.h> has been
	included, because off_t might not be defined otherwise.
	Reported by James W. McKelvey, John L. Chmielewski, Karl
	Vogel, Kaveh R. Ghazi an and Jim Meyering and Tilman Schmidt.

1994-09-14  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Cleanup...
	(DISTFILES): Distribute TAGS.
	(ansi2knr): Use $(LIBS).
	(TAGS): Make TAGS in $(srcdir) only.
	(distclean): Do not remove TAGS.
	(realclean): Remove TAGS.
	(Makefile): Have ./config.status create this Makefile only.

1994-09-13  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* buffer.c: Remove the presetting of stdlis, because stdout is
	not a constant in GNU libc.
	Reported by Joseph E. Sacco and Thomas Bushnell n/BSG.

	* buffer.c (new_volume): Pass an otherwise unused argument to
	wait, do not use NULL.
	Reported by Thomas Bushnell n/BSG.

1994-09-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in (TAGS): Remove -t on etags call.  It has been
	the default behavior for a few releases of Emacs and it seems that
	option -t is now disappearing (from Emacs 19.25, at least).
	Reported by Goeran Uddeborg.

1994-09-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* gnu.c (get_dir_contents): Do not set dp->allnew if dp is not
	set itself.
	Reported by Piercarlo Grandi.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): Issue diagnostic or verbose
	messages to msg_file, instead of stdout.
	Reported by Piercarlo Grandi.

1994-08-24  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Replace calls to AC_REMOTE_TAPE and AC_RSH
	with equivalent code, since those macros are going away.

1994-08-23  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Do not declare alloca if already defined, so HP's
	+Olibcalls compiler option works.
	Reported by John David Anglin.

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Use REMOTE_SHELL only if defined.
	Otherwise, if the command argument has been specified and
	REMOTE_SHELL is not defined, immediately return an error.
	Reported by Bruno Haible, Kaveh R. Ghazi, Marty Leisner,
	Torkel Hasle and William Bader.

	Because --rsh-command may always be given, even if no remote shell
	was found at configure time, remote capabilities are always
	compiled.  This also solve other problems related to RTAPELIB.
	* Makefile.in: Always compile $Urtapelib.o.
	* buffer.c (child_open): Always test _remdev, do not depend
	anymore on HAVE_RTAPELIB.
	* rmt.h [!HAVE_RTAPELIB]: Remove some code.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab and Vic Abell.

	* rtapelib.c: Remove unused COMPAT (mis)feature.  Remove most
	length limitations for remote host name, remote user name and
	remote device name.  Duplicate path, and free it in all cases.
	* (_rmt_rexec): The `user' parameter may never by the empty
	string.  Remove code for that case.

1994-08-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Little cleanup in installation:
	* Makefile.in: Remove rule for ../lib/libtar.a.

1994-08-21  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Correct for when a different	build directory.

	* tar.h: Replace W* definitions.  Adapted from make 3.71.
	* buffer.c (close_archive): Replace WIFCOREDUMPED by
	WCOREDUMP.  Previous WIFSIGNALED definition was excluding SIGSTOP,
	new definition do not exclude it anymore.  We'll see.
	Reported by Demizu Noritoshi, Greg Black, Kaveh R. Ghazi,
	Robert E. Brown and Russ Evans.

1994-08-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	This might (?) solve the dirent problems on NeXT's and Apollo's:
	* tar.h: Change includes and defines from older AC_DIR_HEADER
	style to newer and clearer AC_HEADER_DIRENT style.
	* create.c, gnu.c: Replace NLENGTH by NAMLEN.
	Reported by Drew Trieger, Hugh Secker-Walker, James W. McKelvey,
	Robert E. Brown and Thomas Krebs.

1994-08-17  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Remove some shadowings.
	* update.c (update_archive): Rename head_standard to unused.
	* buffer.c (open_archive): Rename head to label.
	(fl_read): Rename head to cursor.

	* gnu.c (dirent_cmp): Use (char *const *), not (const char **)
	for not loosing the const specifier while casting.

	* mangle.c (extract_mangle): Remove unused argument.
	* tar.h: Adjust prototype.
	* extract.c (extract_archive): Caller changed.

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Remove useless mode parameter.
	* rmt.h, tar.h: Adjust prototype.
	* rmt.h: Adjust macros calling __rmt_open.
	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): Remove unused argument.
	* create.c (dump_file): Caller changed.
	Reported by Greg Black.

	* Makefile.in: Avoid $U in defining RTAPELIB.  Remove both
	rtapelib.o and _urtapelib.o explicit rules, not needed anymore.
	* rmt.h, buffer.c [HAVE_RTAPELIB]: Instead of !NO_REMOTE.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* Makefile.in: Correct a typo in $Ubuffer.o dependencies.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_ioctl): Compile the MTIOCGET case only if
	this symbol is defined.  This also solves a missing mt_type field
	on NS32016 running SysVr2.2.
	Reported by Greg Black.

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_ioctl) : Conditionnalize only the MTIOCTOP
	case, not the whole routine, with the MTIOCTOP symbol.  In case of
	unrecognized operation, return EOPNOTSUPP instead of EINVAL.
	* rmt.h: Always provide a prototype for __rmt_ioctl.  Delete
	the RMTIOCTL machinery.

1994-08-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.c, buffer.c: Use a more uniform way of including
	<sys/mtio.h> or its alternates.
	Reported by Daniel R. Guilderson and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* Makefile.in: Split rule for $Urtapelib.o into one rule for
	rtapelib.o and one rule for _rtapelib.o, taking care of the fact
	that rtapelib.c is in $(srcdir) while _rtapelib.c is in current
	directory.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, Kaveh R. Ghazi, Minh Tran-Le and
	Per Foreby.

	* rmt.c (string_error): Correct DEBUG2 into DEBUG1, and strint
	into string.
	Reported by Anders Andersson, Bruno Haible, Thomas Krebs and
	Thomas König.

	* Makefile.in: Add $U's to rtapelib and rmt specific rules.
	Reported by Thomas König.

1994-08-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* rmt.c (numeric_error): Renamed from error.
	(string_error): New, to replace ERROR ((...)), unavailable in rmt.c.

	* rmt.c (checkbuf): Do not accept, nor return record.  Use the
	global instead.  This will get rid of useless shadowings.

	* rmt.h: Give prototypes for __rmt_* routines.
	* rtapelib.c: Include "rmt.h".
	* update.c (move_arch): Cast last rmtioctl argument to char *.
	* buffer.c (backspace_output): Idem.
	* diffarch.c (verify_volume): Idem.

	* Makefile.in (rmt): Declare dependencies over rmt.h.

1994-08-13  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Include <sys/wait.h> if it exists, whether POSIX or not.
	Check if WIFSTOPPED is defined, to decide if defining others WIF*.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

1994-08-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* extract.c (extract_archive) [O_CTG]: Declare longname variable.
	Initialize it as NULL.  This dirty kludge will allow the module to
	compile on Masscomp's, for the time being.
	Reported by Ben A. Mesander.

	* tar.h, rtapelib.c: Declare strstr if we replaced it.
	Reported by Ben A. Mesander, Christian T. Dum and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

1994-08-10  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* create.c (dump_file): Do not test only for hpux, but also
	for __hpux.  I added __hpux__ too, as done in tar.h.
	Reported by Richard Lloyd.

	* tar.h: Do not include <sys/mknod.h> anymore for HP-UX from
	HP-UX 8 and after, for which definitions are in <sys/sysmacros.h>,
	and reorganize the tests in this area.
	Reported by Christian T. Dum, Dimitris Fousekis, Kimmy Posey,
	Michael Maass, Richard Lloyd and Thomas König.

1994-08-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	These changes for const-cleaning gnu.c and tar.c:
	* tar.c (read_name_from_file): Work directly on global
	variables instead of accepting parameters.  Return success or
	failure as an int instead of the relocated name_buffer.
	(name_next): Caller changed, internal clean-up of the function.
	Remove trailing slashes on the command call too, not only when
	reading from a file through -T option.
	* gnu.c: Add const to name and dir_text in struct dirname.
	Reported by Ben A. Mesander, Bruno Haible, Christian T. Dum,
	Dean Gaudet, James W. McKelvey, Richard Lloyd and Robert E. Brown.

1994-08-08  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (name_next, name_gather, addname): Use strcmp for
	checking for "-C", instead of decomposed tests, just for clarity.

	* Makefile.in (RSH): Define from configuration.
	(rtapelib.o): Define REMOTE_SHELL from $(RSH) while compiling.
	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): If command not given, use
	REMOTE_SHELL, instead of cascading tries of filenames.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* tar.c: Include <fnmatch.h> if FNM_LEADING_DIR is not
	defined, instead of checking for FNM_PATHNAME, because some
	<unistd.h> define the later without defining the former.
	Reported by Thomas König.

	* create.c (dump_file): Cast alloca results, for those
	compilers not processing void * properly.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* Makefile.in: Get prefix and exec_prefix from configure.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, Christian T. Dum and Dean Gaudet.

	* src/port.c: Delete mkdir (and rmdir), rename, strstr and
	ftruncate replacements.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi (for memset and strstr).
	Reported by Bruno Haible (for mkdir and rename).

1994-08-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Replace msg_file by stdlis.
	* buffer.c, gnu.c, list.c, diffarch.c: Idem.

	* tar.c (main): Print version on stdout, not stderr.

	* tar.h: Unconditionnaly insert the pad.  Why play the game of
	forcing the compiler to do it for us?  (Hum!  I'm not so sure.)
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* list.c (read_header): Initialize signed_sum to 0.  Use this
	opportunity for slightly reorganizing the code around.
	Reported by Anders Andersson, Andrey A. Chernov, Bruno Haible
	and Chris Ransom.

	* tar.c: Declare name_buffer_length as size_t instead of int.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, J.T. Conklin, Kaveh R. Ghazi and
	Robert E. Brown.

	* rmt.h: Have the NO_REMOTE case be a particular case of the
	other, for rmtopen and rmtcreat were not transmitting the proper
	number of parameters to open and creat (since 26 July 1994).
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): Delay changing owner to after
	doing utime, for keeping long enough the permission of utime'ing.
	(extract_archive, restore_saved_dir_info): Idem for directories.
	Reported by Jonathan I. Kamens.

	* tar.h: Change malloc_dbg to dmalloc, mutatis mutandis.

	* tar.h: Undefine many macros if stat macros found to be
	broken.  Define mkfifo only if configure did not find it.
	Include <sys/param.h> if not _POSIX_SOURCE, then <unistd.h> if
	we have it, than "pathmax.h".  Move _POSIX_VERSION dependent
	code further down.  Do not declare getcwd if we do not have it.
	* tar.c: Do not include <unistd.h>, now in "tar.h".
	Reported by Bernard Chen, Jean-Michel Soenen, John L.
	Chmielewski and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* tar.h: Define DEV_BSIZE, ST_BLKSIZE and ST_NBLOCKS,
	borrowing this code from both fileutils-3.9's "lib/system.h" and
	textutils-1.9's "system.h".
	* create.c (dump_file): Straighten the test for sparseness,
	which was requiring one block too much, most probably for trying
	to get around DEV_BSIZE/st_blksize confusion.  Use ST_NBLOCKS,
	instead of computing a variable block_size and doing specific
	tests for HP-UX or Linux.  Also rewrite the test so it works
	when ST_NBLOCKS is unsigned.
	Reported by Bruno Haible, Dean Gaudet, Dick Streefland, Harald
	König, Jim Meyering, Kai Petzke, Kaveh R. Ghazi and Torkel Hasle.

1994-08-04  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c: Do not include <unistd.h> if we do not have it.

	Reported by Demizu Noritoshi, Kaveh R. Ghazi and William Bader.

	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Replace system by remote, twice.
	Reported by Ben A. Mesander, Christian T. Dum, Demizu Noritoshi
	and Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* tar.c (addname): Replace a forgotten EX_SYSTEM by
	TAREXIT_FAILURE.

	Ghazi and Robert E. Brown.

1994-08-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c (assign_string): New routines.
	* create.c (dump_file, start_header), extract.c
	(extract_archive), list.c (list_archive, read_header),
	buffer.c (open_archive), diffarch.c (diff_archive): Use
	assign_string for setting these variables to a string value or
	NULL.
	* buffer.c (open_archive): Sets current_file_name,
	current_link_name and save_name to NULL.
	(close_archive): Free each of them if not NULL.
	(fl_write): Take a copy of save_name into cursor, and advance the
	cursor instead, because save_name should stay free-able.
	Reported by Dave Gentzel, Harald Anlauf, Mark Clements, Robert
	Weissenfels, Ronald van Loon, Tsutomu Yamada and Vic Abell.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): Use xstrdup, for clarity.
	* gnu.c (add_dir): Idem.

	* list.c (print_header): Correct a little bug by which
	non-symbolic links were not printed properly quoted.

	* diffarch.c (diff_archive): Allocate tmpbuf to the proper
	size.  NAMSIZ + 2 is not necessarily enough.

1994-08-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Refresh str*/mem* configured declarations.  Among
	other things, this will solve previously missing #undef's.
	* rmt.h: Revise strchr configured declaration.
	* *.c: Replace bzero by memset, bcopy by memcpy, bcmp by
	memcmp, index by strchr and rindex by strrchr.
	* port.c: Delete functions bzero and bcmp, said to not exist
	on Minix.  AC_MINIX in configure.in should guarantee POSIX things.
	Reported by Drew Trieger, Hugh Secker-Walker and Vic Abell.

	* tar.h, tar.c, buffer.c, update.c: Change CMD_* to COMMAND_*.

	* buffer.c (open_archive): Use strcmp to compare archive name
	to `-', instead of doing it explicitely.  Just for clarity.

	* tar.h, tar.c, buffer.c: Replace ar_files by
	archive_name_array, n_ar_files by archive_names and ar_files_len
	by allocated_archive_names.  Replace the index cur_ar_file by
	archive_name_cursor, which is a cursor in archive_name_array.

	* tar.c (main): Move the initialization of
	archive_name_array at beginning, taken from options routine.
	Free it at end of main.
	(options): Use xrealloc instead of ck_realloc for archive_name,
	for the already saved names to be preserved.
	Reported by Per Bojsen.

	* tar.h, tar.c: Replace name_file by namefile_name.
	* tar.c: Replace n_ind by name_array, n_indused by names,
	n_indalloc by allocated_names, and n_indscan by name_index.
	Replace namef by name_file, n_argv by names_argv and n_argc by
	names_argc.
	(main): Make an initial allocation for name_array at beginning,
	moved out from name_add, free it at end of main.

	* buffer.c (close_archive): Free ar_block at end.

1994-07-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h [WITH_MALLOC_DBG]: Include "malloc_dbg.h".

	* create.c (create_archive): Do not attempt creating a
	directory summary file if -G, since -G sets gnu_dumpfile to 0.
	Reported by Alexander Dupuy.

	* create.c (dump_file): Avoid a NULL dereference with -G when
	trying to dump an empty directory.
	* gnu.c (add_dir_name): Same thing.
	Reported by Rainer Orth.

	Correction for the improper `data differs' diagnostic given when
	the continuation of a multi-volume was compared.
	* diffarch.c (diff_archive): If multi-volume, update save_name
	and save_totsize before calling wantbytes.
	* buffer.c (wantbytes): If multi-volume, update save_sizeleft.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab, Denis Fortin, François Pinard,
	Hiroyuki Bessho, Olaf Schlueter, Simon Wright and Saul Lubkin.

1994-07-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

1994-07-29  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* create.c (dump_file): Abort if no memory for a possible
	link, remove related bogus code, and the variable nolinks.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* create.c (dump_file): Detect file sparseness correctly for
	Linux ext2 filesystem.
	Reported by Kai Petzke.

	* port.c (link) [!MSDOS]: Do not call setmode.
	Reported by Richard Deal.

	Reorganization for `tar -d' to provide a different exit status.
	* tar.h: Replace errors by exit_status.  Declare TAREXIT_*.
	* buffer.c (child_open): Exit with exit_status.
	* tar.c (main): Initialize exit_status to TAREXIT_SUCCESS, and
	exit with exit_status.
	* buffer.c, diffarch.c, gnu.c, list.c, port.c,
	rmt.c, tar.c, update.c: Replace EXIT_FAILURE by
	TAREXIT_FAILURE, and EXIT_SUCCESS by TAREXIT_SUCCESS.
	* tar.h (ERROR), create.c (dump_file): Set exit_status to
	TAREXIT_FAILURE instead of increasing errors.
	* diffarch.c (sigh, diff_sparse_files): On differences, set
	exit_status to TAREXIT_DIFFERS if nothing more serious already.
	Reported by Tilman Schmidt.

	* rmt.c: Define EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS if not already.
	* rtapelib.c: Define EXIT_ON_EXEC_ERROR to 128 and use it.

	* diffarch.c (sigh): Increment errors, so a difference will
	yield a non-zero exit status at end.
	Reported by Nick Holloway.

	* tar.h: Rename TARERROR to WARN, then add ERROR which is similar,
	but increments the errors counter.
	* *.c: Replace all TARERROR by WARN or ERROR, deciding for each
	case.  Many errors were not reflected in exit status.

	Reported by Carl Streeter, Esa Karell, George Chyu, Ian Jackson,
	Judy Ricker, Massimo Dal Zotto, Roland McGrath, Tilman Schmidt
	and Torkel Hasle.

	* buffer.c (child_open): Exit with EXIT_FAILURE if any error.

	* rtapelib.c: Use error for reporting errors.
	(do_command): New name for command.
	(get_status): New name for status.

	* buffer.c: Remove definition of MAGIC_STAT.
	(close_archive): Do not check MAGIC_STAT for an exit value, since
	this value is never returned.

	* *.c: Use TARERROR or exit with EXIT_FAILURE, instead of various
	esoteric statuses.  Normalize using TARERROR with an exit status,
	instead of calling TARERROR with 0 first, then _exit.  On exit
	calls, use EXIT_SUCCESS instead of 0.
	* tar.c: Do not use the exit status anymore for outputting an
	error counter value.  Wrap around was creating spurious success.
	* tar.h: Remove EX_* definitions for tar exit statuses.
	Reported by Bob Mende and Torbjorn Granlund.

1994-07-26  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Add f_rsh_command variable.
	* tar.c: Add and process --rsh-command option.
	* buffer.c (open_archive, child_open, new_volume): Pass
	f_rsh_command to rmtopen and rmtcreat calls.
	* rmt.h (rmtopen, rmtcreat): Pass a supplementary argument.
	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Accept and process a command
	argument, to replace rsh.
	Reported by Jonathan I. Kamens.

	* tar.h: Instead of including <sys/file.h> with BSD42 or
	<fcntl.h> for V7, merely include <fcntl.h> if it exists,
	otherwise <sys/file.h>.
	* buffer.c, diffarch.c, extract.c, list.c,
	port.c, update.c: Do not include <fcntl.h> or
	<sys/file.h>, because they are indirectly included through
	"tar.h".

	* create.c (dump_file): Remove the BSD42 conditional.  If not
	f_sparse_files, initialize upperbound as when not BSD42.
	Reported by Alan Bawden, Claude Scarpelli, Laurent
	Sainte-Marthe, Noah Friedman, Reuben Sumner, Tom Quinn and
	William Bader.

1994-07-24  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Merely define valloc as being malloc if valloc does
	not exist.
	* port.h: Remove valloc, which was only a dummy for malloc.
	Reported by Cliff Krumvieda, Francois Pinard, Henrik Bakman,
	J.T. Conklin, Nelson H.F. Beebe and Tilman Schmidt.

1994-07-22  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* create.c (start_header): Cast NAMSIZ to size_t before
	comparing it to strlen result.
	Reported by Mark Frost.

	* tar.c (main): Zero out label_pattern before compiling in
	regular expressions, instead of using uninitialized memory.
	Reported by Holger Teutsch.

	* tar.c [!FNM_PATHNAME]: Include fnmatch.h only if unistd.h fails
	to define this symbol.
	Reported by Alan Modra, Christian T. Dum, Eddy ?, John
	Oleynick and Richard Lloyd.

	* buffer.c, diffarch.c, rtapelib.c, update.c:
	Include <sys/io/trioctl.h> before <sys/mtio.h>, if it exists.
	Reported by Kaveh R. Ghazi.

	* tar.c (options): Use defined OPTION_* constants instead of
	anonymous numbers for long options not having a short option form.

	* rmt.h [!MTIOCTOP]: Do not define RMTIOCTL, so __rmt_ioctl
	will not be called if it has not been compiled in rtapelib.c.

	* tar.h: Add CMD_TOO_MANY.
	* tar.c (main): Use CMD_TOO_MANY, and get rid of badopt label.
	Reported by David J. MacKenzie.

	* tar.c (usage): New name for describe().  Rewritten with
	better help formatting and more logical grouping of options.
	Accepts an exit status argument.  Callers adapted.
	Reported by Richard O'Neill.

1994-07-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* port.c (rename): Constify the arguments.
	Reported by Elmar Heeb, Jeff Prothero and John Clark.

	* tar.c (main): Declare version_string locally.
	* version.c: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.

1994-07-19  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.h: Merge "port.h" towards the beginning of tar.h.
	Include <stdio.h> and <errno.h>, and define errno if needed.
	* *.c: Do not include "port.h" anymore after "tar.h", do not
	include <stdio.h>, <errno.h> nor <sys/types.h>.  Also move
	"tar.h" as the first file included in every module.  This
	would solve, among other things, the problem of RE_DUP_MAX
	being redefined by <limits.h>, when included after "regex.h".
	* port.h: Deleted.
	* Makefile.in: Adjusted.
	Reported by Alan Modra, Christian T. Dum, Dimitris Fousekis,
	John David Anglin, Matthew Braun, Michael Maass, Richard Lloyd
	and Stefan Skoglund.

	* create.c (dump_file): Do not cast alloca result to (char *).
	The problem reported was that alloca result was seen as int, but
	with the changes just made, alloca should be properly declared.
	Reported by Bryant Fujimoto and Michael Kubik.

1994-07-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* create.c, extract.c [HAVE_UTIME_H]: Instead of _POSIX_VERSION,
	for choosing to include <utime.h>.
	Reported by Carl Swanson and Thomas Krebs.

1994-07-05  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* tar.c: Replace DEF_AR_FILE with DEFAULT_ARCHIVE, replace
	DEFBLOCKING with DEFAULT_BLOCKING.

	* rtapelib.c: Replace "??'" by "?? '" at two places in a
	comment, so avoiding Pyramid's DC/OSx compiler to complain about
	ANSI trigraph sequences.  Even comments can trigger bugs, now!
	Reported by Mark Frost.

	* tar.h: Declare valloc.
	* buffer.c, diffarch.c: Remove declaration for valloc.

	* testpad.c: Deleted.
	* tar.h: Do not include "testpad.h" anymore.
	* Makefile.in: Delete testpad matters.

	* buffer.c (new_volume): Inside case 'n', strcpy into r then
	assign r to p, instead of strcpy'ing directly into p, for making
	the module const clean.

1994-07-03  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	Rename a few variables to avoid shadowing variables or functions:
	* list.c (print_header): Change name to quoted_name.
	* buffer.c (child_open): Change pipe to local_pipe.
	* extract.c (extract_archive): Change namelen to namelen_bis.
	* rtapelib.c (__rmt_open): Change system to remote.

	* tar.c (options): Add two missing arguments to getoldopt
	call, NULL is not necessarily implied on all systems.

	* list.c (print_header): Add a few missing long specification
	in formats.
	* diffarch.c (compare_chunk, diff_sparse_files): Idem.
	* port.c (msg, msg_perror): Idem.

	* tar.h: Include prototypes for all functions which call from
	one module to another.  Declare voidstar (use it everywhere
	instead of PTR).  Move in the include <sys/stat.h> from
	<port.h>, and the include of option.h from tar.c and
	getoldopt.c, waiting for a better solution for all these things.
	* port.c: Removed PTR declaration and including <sys/stat.h>.
	* getoldopt.c, tar.c: Remove including "option.h".

1994-07-02  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* *: Protoized all function headers.  Added static to
	functions which can take it.  Add many const specifiers.  Remove
	unused variables.

	* port.c (xmalloc): Delete function, do not mask the true one.
	* port.c (ck_malloc): Use xmalloc, waiting for annihilation.
	* port.c (ck_realloc): Use xrealloc, waiting for annihilation.
	* *: Begin switching from ck_malloc (or even pure malloc) to
	xmalloc.  Same for ck_realloc (pure realloc) to xrealloc.
	Doing this correctly is a delicate matter, which I'll continue
	without reporting it anymore, while doing other modifications.

	* *: Replace msg and msg_perror calls by TARERROR macro calls.
	Capitalize first word of all error messages, remove ending
	punctuation or newline.  Systematically avoid contractions for
	`Cannot' and `Could not'.  Always write `WARNING:' all in capitals.
	* tar.h: Declare TARERROR as calling error().  Rename
	variable tar to program_name.
	* tar.c (main, options), buffer.c (child_open), port.c
	(msg, msg_perror), gnu.c (gnu_restore): Rename variable tar to
	program_name.
	* gnu.c (gnu_restore): Remove a spurious repetition of
	program_name in error message.

1994-07-01  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* buffer.c, create.c extract.c, gnu.c, list.c,
	names.c, rmt.c, tar.c, update.c: Remove all (void)
	prefixes to function calls.  There are limits to lint clutter.

1994-06-30  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* port.h: Remove definition of const.  Let configure do it.

	* tar.h, rmt.c, rtapelib.c, version.c, testpad.c: Add a block
	for including <config.h> or "config.h".  If "tar.h" was included
	everywhere, the block will only be needed there.

	* *.[ch]: Reindented to GNU standards (they were not far).
	Got rid of all `* ' left prefixes in comments and refilled them.
	There is still a lot of cosmetic changes needed everywhere.
	I will not report them any more, doing them along the way of
	other things in the future.

	* Makefile.in: New file.

	* Split distribution into a few subdirectories, for easing
	maintainance.

	* Taking over maintenance duties.

1994-02-13  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extern.h, global.c, main.c, util.c:  Added code to
	tape_buffered_peek() to properly handle large, corrutped
	archives, without overrunning the allocated buffer and
	dumping core.  Also changed the way the input and output
	buffers are allocated in initialize_buffers().

1994-01-25  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* copyin.c, copyout.c, copypass.c, extern.h, main.c, tar.c, util.c:
	Redid i/o buffer code.  Previously, the same routines buffered input and
	output for accessing the archive and the filesystem.  Now there are
	separate routines for buffering input and output and for buffering the
	archive and the filesystem.  This simplifies much of the buffer code
	(e.g., only input from the archive has to check for end of tape and
	allow the tape to be changed, only output to the filesystem has to
	handle byte and word swapping, etc.; previously one routine had to
	handle all of these special cases) This is how the routines got split
	and renamed (old name -> new name):

		clear_rest_of_block -> tape_clear_rest_of_block
		copy_files -> copy_files_tape_to_disk
		    "      -> copy_files_disk_to_disk
		    "      -> copy_files_disk_to_tape
		copy_buf_out -> disk_buffered_write
		    "        -> tape_buffered_write
		copy_in_buf -> tape_buffered_read
		empty_output_buffer -> tape_empty_output_buffer
		    "               -> disk_empty_output_buffer
		fill_input_buffer -> tape_fill_input_buffer
		    "             -> disk_fill_input_buffer
		pad_output -> tape_pad_output
		peek_in_buf -> tape_buffered_peek
		skip_padding -> tape_skip_padding
		toss_input -> tape_toss_input

	* extern.h, global.c, main.c, util.c:  Added support for
	writing sparse files.

1993-12-28  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* util.c, system.h, makepath.c, extern.h: don't define chown()
	and don't typedef uid_t and gid_t if we are being compiled
	by DJGPP.

	* copyin.c, extern.h, global.c, main.c:  Added support for
	--rename-batch-file.

	* copyin.c, copyout.c, extern.h:  Cleaned up to pass gcc -Wall.

1993-12-22  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* makepath.c, copypass.c, copyin.c:  If cpio was creating a
	directory that contained `.' in the pathname (e.g. `foo/./bar'),
	it would complain that it could not create `.', since it already
	exists.  From schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de (Andreas
	Schwab).

	* mt.c:  Added "eject" as a synonym for "offline".

	* util.c:  Slight modification to when we lseek with
	BROKEN_LONG_TAPE_DRIVER (do it every 1Gb, instead
	of every 2Gb).

	* copyin.c, global.c, extern.h:  Added --no-absolute-paths option,
	to ignore absolute paths in archives.

1993-12-21  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* util.c:  Fix for copying new_media_message_after_number.  From
	Christian.Kuehnke@arbi.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de (Christian
	Kuehnke).

1993-08-31  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* rmt.c [M_UNIX]: Include sys/tape.h instead of sys/mtio.h.
	Reported by Drew Sullivan and William Bader.

1993-07-29  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (config.status): Run config.status --recheck, not
	configure, to get the right args passed.

	* Makefile.in (config.status): Run config.status --recheck, not
	configure, to get the right args passed.

1993-07-19  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (libdir): Use standard GNU value --
	$(exec_prefix)/lib, not /etc.

1993-07-19  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (libdir): Use standard GNU value --
	$(exec_prefix)/lib, not /etc.
	(.c.o): Put CFLAGS last.

1993-07-08  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (installdirs, configure, config.status,
	Makefile): New targets.

1993-07-08  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Add rules for remaking Makefile, configure,
	config.status.

1993-07-05  John Oleynick  <juo@spiff.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* cpio.1:  Updated man page for 2.3.
	* Makefile.in:  Create distribution with .gz extension, instead of .z.

1993-06-29  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in: Added installdirs target (using mkinstalldirs).
	* Added mkinstalldirs script.
	* main.c, mt.c:  Added --help option.  Changed usage() to
	take a stream and exit value (so --help can print on stdout
	and return a 0 exit status).
	* extern.h:  Removed usage()'s prototype (it was out of date,
	and only used in main.c).

1993-06-14  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (.c.o): Put -I. before -I$(srcdir), and make
        $(CFLAGS) last.

1993-05-22  The King  <elvis@graceland.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extract.c (extract_archive, restore_saved_dir_info): Print
	mode in octal, not in decimal.
	Reported by Scott S. Bertilson.

1993-05-06  John Oleynick  <juo@hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* cpio.1:  Added hpbin and hpodc.

1993-05-04  John Oleynick  <juo@hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* copyin.c (process_copy_in), copypass.c (process_copy_pass):  When
	deleting an existing file, if the file is a directory, use rmdir()
	instead of unlink().

1993-04-29  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (read_in_tar_header):  Clear non-protection bits from
	mode, in case tar has left some device bits in there.

1993-04-28  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* util.c: Added code to try and work around broken tape drivers
	that have problems with tapes > 2Gb.

	* copyout.c (process_copy_out): Pass file_hdr to
	writeout_other_defers() and add_link_defer() by reference,
	not by value.

	* copyin.c (process_copy_in): Pass file_hdr to defer_copyin()
	and create_defered_links() by reference, not by value.

	* defer.c: include <sys/types.h> (to build on BSD 4.3 on HP300)

	* mt.c, util.c: Include <sys/mtio.h> if HAVE_SYS_MTIO_H is
	defined, not HAVE_MTIO_H.

1993-04-14  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* util.c: Include <sys/io/trioctl.h> if HAVE_SYS_IO_TRIOCTL_H
	is defined.

	* mt.c: Only include <sys/mtio.h> if HAVE_SYS_MTIO_H is defined.

1993-04-02  John Oleynick  <juo@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* copyin.c: Only include "fnmatch.h" if FNM_PATHNAME isn't
	defined yet.

	* mt.c: Include <sys/io/trioctl.h> if HAVE_SYS_IO_TRIOCTL_H is
	defined.

1993-03-29  John Oleynick  <juo@hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* Many changes for supporting HPUX Context Dependent Files;
	also some bug fixes to fix problems with multiply (hard) linked
	device files; minor changes to support HPUX format archives
	(slightly broken?) System V.4 posix tar archives and HPUX
	posix tar archives.

	* Makefile.in: New files defer.o, defer,c and defer.h; added

	multiple (hard) link code to new routines link_name() and
	link_to_maj_min_ino(); use new macro UMASKED_SYMLINK instead of
	symlink().

	* copyout.c: fixes to properly handle multiple links in newc
	and crc format archives (new routines last_link(),
	count_defered_links_to_dev_ino(), add_link_defer(),
	writeout_other_defers(), writeout_final_defers(),
	writeout_defered_file()); support for new arf_hpbinary and
	arf_hpascii formats; support for HPUX CDF's.

1993-03-26  Noah Friedman  <friedman@nutrimat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure.in: Better way of detecting HP-UX.
	Reported by Noah Friedman.

1993-03-25  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* version.c: Released version 1.11.2.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Do the link differently; some of the
	files have changed filesystems which makes it more complex.

	* Makefile.in (dist, shar): Use gzip instead of compress.

	* create.c (dump_file): Test for curdev == -1, not curdev < 0.
	Some losing NFS systems give negative device numbers sometimes.
	Reported by Thorbjxrn Willoch.

1993-03-19  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c (new_volume): Write the global volume number to the
	volno file before running the info script, so that the script
	can look at it.

1993-03-17  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (describe, long_options): Changed --compress-block to
	--block-compress.
	(options): Fixed f_compress_block sanity check error message
	to give the correct name of the option.

1993-03-16  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extract.c (extract_archive): case LF_DIR: Do chown when
	necessary.  Don't bother jumping to set_filestat for
	f_modified; repeat the chmod code here.  Replace `break',
	deleted on 2 September 1992.

	* tar.c (describe, long_options, options): Added gzip options
	and use-compress-program option.
	* tar.h: Added new compression options.
	* buffer.c (child_open, open_archive): Use new compression options.

	* create.c (start_header): Only mask off high bits when
	creating old-style archives.
	* list.c (decode_header): Mask off potentially misleading
	high bits from the mode when reading headers.
	Reported by Paul Eggert.

1993-03-15  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* extract.c (extract_archive): Put arguments in the right
	order for error message.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): If the last byte was null, we
	didn't write it out.

	* gnu.c, create.c, extract.c, diffarch.c, list.c:
	Replace malloc calls with ck_malloc and realloc with ck_realloc.
	Reported by Jonathan Kamens.

	* tar.c (describe): Improve doc for -L.

	* tar.c (name_next): Don't apply exclusion to explicitly named
	files.

	* tar.c (long_options, describe): Added new-volume-script as
	an alias for info-script.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): LF_DUMPDIR case; misplaced paren.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): extract_file case, first if,
	include space for null in namelen computation.

	* extract.c (extract_sparse_file): Use value returned by write
	to properly create error message.

	* create.c (create_archive): Don't assume we have anything to
	dump.

	* buffer.c (open_archive): Set current_file_name for the
	volume header so that verbose listings work properly.

	* Makefile.in (realclean): Added getdate.c.

	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): If exactly 26 elements in
	sparsearray, only 25 were written.
	Reported by Jim Murray.

	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): If the file ends with a zero
	block, the last byte was not written.  This is fixed in create
	rather than extract: if amidst_data is not set at EOF, put out a
	block with just the last byte of the file.
	Reported by Jim Murray.

1993-03-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@comco.com>

	* copypass.c (process_copy_pass): Use <=, not just <, when comparing
	mtimes.  From Pieter Bowman <bowman@math.utah.edu>.

1993-01-15  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@kropotkin.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* copyin.c: Move include of fnmatch.h to get right FNM* macros.

	* tar.c (options, main): Advise use of --help rather than
	+help.
	Reported by J.T. Conklin.

	* create.c (write_long): Using hstat here is a Bad Idea, and

	either, so just store the names in malloced areas.  Sigh.

	* NEWS: New file.
	* README: Removed things that belong in NEWS; point to it.

	* list.c (read_header): current_file_name and
	current_link_name need to be set to the arrays in head rather

	* extract.c: Removed long name support from here.
	* list.c (read_header): Understand and skip longname/longlink

	come from the command line, they aren't malloced, and it isn't
	important to save this trivial amount of memory.

	* tar.h: replace ar_file with ar_files, n_ar_files,
	cur_ar_files.
	* buffer.c (open_archive): multi-volume compressed archives
	never worked; give an appropriate error.  Change open of
	ar_file to open of ar_files[0].
	(writeerror, readerror, flush_archive): use
	ar_files[cur_ar_file] instead of ar_file.
	(new_archive): Necessary changes to support ar_files.
	* tar.c (options): handle multiple tape drive arguments.

1992-08-28  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* list.c (decode_header), create.c (start_header), tar.h (TMAGIC):
	Undo djm's changes below; tar does not support the final

1991-11-21  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@nutrimat>

	* create.c (dump_file, at start of ISREG output loop): use
	filename from header instead of real name to make sure that we
	get the mangled version and not one that is too long and
	overflows buffers.

1991-11-16  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.h: Use new criteria for STDC version of msg.

	* Version 1.5.

	* bcopy.c: New file (moved from util.c).

	* mt.c (print_status): Not all hpux machines have mt_fileno

	just assume none of them have them.

	* util.c (copy_buf_out, copy_in_buf): Use more efficient
	copying technique for a big speedup.

1991-08-19  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

1991-08-14  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* list.c (UGSWIDTH): Increase from 11 (sort of like Unix tar) to

	the columns never shift in a tar -t listing.

1991-08-02  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@apple-gunkies>

	* Makefile.in (dist): Include texinfo.tex and tar.info*.

	MSDOS function.
	* gnu.c (get_dir_contents): Return NULL, not "\0\0\0\0", on error.

	* tar.h, tar.c: Add +null option to make -T read
	null-terminated filenames (such as those produced by GNU find
	-print0), and disable -C option.
	This guarantees that odd filenames will get archived.
	* tar.c (read_name_from_file): New function.
	(name_next): Call it instead of fgets.
	From David J. MacKenzie.

1991-07-24  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* create.c [_AIX]: Declare alloca.

	* buffer.c (open_archive): Check for successful open before,

1991-07-23  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* configure: Only define BSD42 if sys/file.h exists.

	* gnu.c, create.c, tar.c: Fix decls.

	* port.c: Don't use the preprocessor to guess missing

	getcwd is used if needed.
	* gnu.c, tar.c [POSIX]: Use getcwd.

	* rtapelib.c: Use SIGTYPE instead of testing SIGNAL_VOID.
	Default to void (more common these days) instead of int.

	* gnu.c, tar.c [__MSDOS__ || USG]: Remove incorrect getcwd decl.
	[!POSIX]: Put correct one in port.h.

	* tar.c (describe): Print on stdout instead of stderr; it's
	not so much a usage message (since you have to ask for it
	explicitly) as on-line help, and you really need to be able to
	page it because it's more than a screen long.

	* Make #ifdefs for sys/file.h or fcntl.h, directory header,
	sys/mtio.h consistent between files.  Use NO_MTIO instead of
	tricks with USG and HAVE_MTIO and NO_RMTIOCTL.

	use standard headers to declare them if available
	[STDC_HEADERS or POSIX].

	* Some places used __MSDOS__, some MSDOS; standardize on __MSDOS__.
	* Change S_IF macros to S_IS for POSIX.
	* port.h: Define appropriate S_IS macros if missing.
	* port.h [POSIX]: Rename macros for testing exit status to conform to
	POSIX; use the system's versions if available.
	* Use POSIX PATH_MAX and NAME_MAX instead of MAXPATHLEN and MAXNAMLEN.
	* port.h: Define PATH_MAX and NAME_MAX.
	* create.c, gnu.c, tar.c: Use ck_malloc and free instead of
	auto arrays of size PATH_MAX or NAME_MAX, since with pathconf
	they might not be constants.
	* Move all definitions of O_* to port.h to reduce redundancy.
	* Make all source files that now need to include port.h do so.
	* port.c: Remove #undefs of WANT_* so you can use -DWANT_*
	when compiling, instead of having to edit port.c.
	[WANT_DUMB_GET_DATE] (get_date): Function removed.
	Even systems without bison can get bison output and compile it.
	[WANT_STRING] (index, rindex, bcopy, bzero, bcmp): Functions
	removed; the translation is now done by macros in port.h.
	* wildmat.c (wildmat): Use POSIX.2 '!' instead of '^' to negate
	character classes.

	* configure, Makefile.in: $(INSTALLPROG) -> $(INSTALL),
	$(INSTALLTEXT) -> $(INSTALLDATA).

1991-07-09  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	command line globber for Turbo C.

1991-07-08  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* testpad.c: Open and write to testpad.h instead of stdout,
	because some MS-DOS makes (Borland's at least) can't do
	redirection in commands.
	* Makefile.in: Don't redirect testpad output.

1991-07-08  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	even if BSD42 is also.

	This simplifies calculations, removes bugs, and elides the
	second scan through the block.  The first was zero_record, the
	second was where_is_data.

1991-01-07  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@wookumz.ai.mit.edu>

	* create.c (deal_with_sparse): Second computation (for short
	reads) of numbytes increment had subtraction backwards.
	Need to handle calling where_is_data better when we did a
	short read (it might go past the end of the read), also, set
	sparsearray[...].offset in this case too.

1991-01-04  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c: Return a special error code if the archive

	* gnu.c: Don't complain if the gnudumpfile we're reading info
	from doesn't exist.

	* create.c: Write out gnudumpfile after finishing writing the archive.

	* tar.c: Add +exclude FNAME, and make +exclude-from do what +exclude

	multivol files even if they don't match the names we're looking
	for, etc.

	* gnu.c (gnu_restore): Don't use a passed char* for the
	file name, use skipcrud+head->header.name, just like everything

1990-09-02  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@apple-gunkies>

	* getdate.y: Declare some more functions and add storage
	classes where omitted to shut compiler up.
	[USG] (ftime): Don't use extern var `daylight'; appears that
	some systems don't have it.

1990-08-29  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@apple-gunkies>

	* getdate.y (lookup): In the code that allows `Aug.' to be

	work around a pcc bug found on a Convex.

	* version 1.0.

1990-07-02 Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* gnu.c (new file): Moved all the f_gnudump stuff here where we

	f_gnudump.

	* tar.c: Moved the f_gnudump stuff to gnu.c

	* copyin.c (process_copy_in), copyout.c (process_copy_out),

	short arrays, making sure longs are aligned properly.
	(process_copy_in, long_format): Use the long fields.

	(finish_output_file): New function.
	* copyin.c (process_copy_in), copyout.c (process_copy_out),
	copypass.c (process_copy_pass): Set `output_is_seekable'
	correctly and call finish_output_file.
	* main.c (initialize_buffers): Allocate space for sentinel in

	* util.c (empty_output_buffer, fill_input_buffer,
	copy_out_buf, copy_in_buf, toss_input, copy_files): Return
	void instead of an error value and make errors fatal
	immediately instead of several levels up, to prevent printing
	of multiple error messages by different levels of functions.

	* copyin.c (read_in_header): Return void, because the error
	handling all happens at lower levels.
	(print_name_with_quoting): New function.

1990-06-07  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile, buffer.c, diffarch.c [HAVE_MTIO]: Instead of MTIO, as
	SCO Xenix defines 'MTIO' for an incompatible tape driver system in
	a file included by termio.h.
	* tar.h: Don't define size_t for Xenix.

1990-06-05  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* create.c (dump_file): Only print the
	"... is on a different filesystem..." if f_verbose is on.
	also add a case for S_IFSOCK and treat it like a FIFO.

	than all those Unknown File Type msgs.)

1990-05-31  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* port.c [sparc]: Use instead of SPARC since the lowercase version
	is defined, and the uppercase one isn't.

1990-05-31  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* copyin.c (long_format): Use mode_string to format

1990-05-15  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* diffarch.c (diff_archive): If not f_absolute_paths, and attempt
	to open a file listed in the archive fails, try /filename also.
	This will allow diff to open the wrong file if both /filename and
	filename exist, but there's nothing we can do about that.

1990-05-11  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile: Describe new -DMTIO option.

	* buffer.c, diffarch.c: Change ifdefs slightly, so that -DMTIO
	will include sys/mtio.h even if USG is defined.  This is for HPUX
	and similar BSD/USG crossovers.

1990-05-08  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* update.c (update_archive): Call reset_eof() when appropriate.

	* buffer.c (reset_eof): New function, that turns of EOF flag, and

	'tar rf non-existant-file' to not core-dump.

1990-05-04  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c: Recognize the +sparse option.  It was documented, but

	+modification-time to +preserve-modification-time,
	+pass to +pass-through.

	* copyin.c (process_copy_in), copypass.c (process_copy_pass):
	Don't complain in chown fails because the user doesn't have
	permission.

1990-04-13  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* Add ifdefs for USG/Xenix.

	* Move definition of xmalloc from dstring.c to util.c.
	* global.c, extern.c: Add global `program_name'.

	+table to +list.
	Have +block-size take an argument.

1990-04-12  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@rice-chex>

	* util.c (find_inode_file): Make inode an int, not a short.

	* Make functions that don't return a value have type void.
	Add some casts to function calls.

1990-04-11  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c (flush_archive, close_archive, new_volume): Always
	check the return value of rmtclose(), and only give a warning msg
	if it is <0.  Some device drivers (including Sun floppy disk, and
	HP streaming tape) return -1 after an IO error (or something like
	that.)

1990-04-11  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* main.c (process_args): -i, -o, and -p don't take arguments.

	* main.c (process_args): Get the non-option args from the
	correct elements of argv.

1990-04-10  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* Indent source code and update copyrights.

	* cpio.c (usage): Change `collection' to `archive' in message.

	+catenate and +delete don't take arguments.

1990-03-12  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c (open_archive, fl_write): Set the mtime of the volume
	header to the current time.

1990-03-07  Jay Fenlason <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c  Fix +compress-block  A two character patch from
	Juha Sarlin.
	Replace #ifdef __GNU__ with #ifdef __STDC__.
	(new_volume): If open of new archive fails, ask again, as it
	probably is user error.

	* tar.c: Replace #ifdef __GNU__ with #ifdef __STDC__

	* port.c: Clean up #ifdef and #defines a bit.
	(quote_copy_string): Sometimes the malloc'd buffer would be up to
	two characters too short.

	* extract.c (extract_archive): Don't declare ind static.

	* create.c (dump_file): Don't declare index_offset static.

	* diffarch.c: Remove diff_name variable, and always use
	head->header.name, which will always work, unlike diff_name, which
	becomes trash when the next block is read in.

1990-03-01  Jay Fenlason <hack@wookumz.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile: Mention the -NO_REMOTE option.
	* port.c [i386]: Fix typo, and define WANT_FTRUNCATE.

1990-02-26  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@pogo.ai.mit.edu>

	* getdate.y: Declare yylex and yyerror as static.
	#define yyparse to getdate_yyparse.

1990-02-25  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@albert.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c: Remove +old option, since it is a valid abbreviation of
	+old-archive, which does the same thing.
	(describe): A few small cleanups in message.

1990-02-05  Jay Fenlason	<hack@wookumz>

	* port.c [sparc]: Define LOSING_MSG, since doprnt_msg doesn't work.
	[WANT_GETWD]: Fix typo.

1990-01-26  Jay Fenlason	<hack@wookumz>

	Version 1.08 --- Sparse file support added.  Also various other
	features.

	* diffarch.c (compare_chunk): Include correct arguments in
	a call to fprintf() for an error msg.
	(compare_chunks, compare_dir): First argument is a long, not an int.

	* tar.c (options): Use tar variable (argv[0]) as the name to print
 	in an error msg, instead of a constant "tar".
	(confirm): Use external variable char TTY_NAME[] for name of file
	to open for confirmation input.

	* buffer.c (new_volume): Ditto.

	* port.c: Add declaration for TTY_NAME[].

	* rmt.h: Add long declarations for lseek() and __rmt_lseek();

1990-01-23  Jay Fenlason <hack@wookumz>

	* tar.c, create.c: Create the +newer-mtime option, which is like
	+newer, but only looks for files whose mtime is newer than the
	given date.

	* rtape_lib.c [USG]: Make *both* instances of signal-handler stuff
	use void (*foo)().

1990-01-11  Jay Fenlason  <hack@wookumz>

	* getdate.y : Parse European dates of the form YYMMDD.
	In ftime(): Init timezone by calling localtime(), and remember that
	timezone is in seconds, but we want timeb->timezone to be in minutes.
	Reported by Jörgen Haegg.

	* rtape_lib.c (__rmt_open): Also look for /usr/bsd/rsh.
	Declare signal handler as returning void instead of int if USG is
	defined.

	* port.c: Declare WANT_GETWD for SGI 4-D IRIS.

	* Makefile: Include defines for SGI 4D version.
	Reported by Mike Muuss.

	* buffer.c (fl_read): Work properly on broken Ultrix systems where
	read() returns -1 with errno==ENOSPC on end of tape.  Correctly go
	on to the next volume if f_multivol.

	* list.c (list_archive, print_header): Flush msg_file after
	printing messages.

	* port.c: Delete unused references to alloca().
	Don't crash if malloc() returns zero in quote_copy_string.
	Flush stderr in msg() and msg_perror().

	* tar.c: Flush msg_file after printing confirmation msg.

1990-01-10  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (main): Change -help option and references to it to +help,
	and remove suggestion to run info (which is unreleased, so not
	likely to be of any help).

1990-01-09  Jay Fenlason  <hack@wookumz>

	* create.c (dump_file): Close file descriptor if start_header()
	fails.
	(dump_file): Change test for `./'-ness to not think that `.' {any
	character} is a `./'.
	Reported by Piercarlo Grandi.

	* diffarch.c (diff_init): Print correct number of bytes in error
	message.

1990-01-09  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile: Add comment at top noting that two source files also
	contain #defines that might need to be changed by hand.

	* create.c, diffarch.c, extract.c: Change L_SET to 0 in lseek
	calls, because only BSD defines it.
	* create.c (dump_file) [BSD42]: Make sparse file checking code
	conditional because it uses st_blocks, which the other systems lack.

1990-01-02  Jay Fenlason <hack@gnu>

	* port.c (quote_copy_string): Fix so it doesn't scramble memory if
	the last character is non-printable.
	Reported by Kian-Tat Lim.

1989-12-28  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* dstring.c (xmalloc): Don't return a null pointer if size is 0,
	on the assumption that trying to allocate 0 bytes is a bug that
	should be trapped.

1989-12-20  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* All files: Change from GNU CPIO General Public License to
	GNU General Public License.

1989-12-19  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@pogo>

	* port.c [BSD42]: Define DOPRNT_MSG.
	tar.h [BSD42]: Do not prototype msg{,_perror}.

1989-12-18  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile: Add clean target and defines for CC and LDFLAGS.
	Add dist target and SRCS, DISTFILES macros.  Add tags and TAGS targets.
	* dstring.c (ds_fgets): Read characters into an int, not char.
	(xmalloc): New function.
	(out_of_memory): Function removed.
	Global: use xmalloc instead of malloc and out_of_memory.
	* extern.h, global.c: Make flag variables ints instead of chars for
	compatibility with getopt_long.
	* extern.h: Declare more functions.
	* main.c (usage): Put the whole usage message into a single string
	and fix errors.
	* util.c (create_all_directories): Remove unused variable.
	(get_next_reel): Ditto.
	* dstring.h: Declare function.

1989-12-08  Jay Fenlason <hack@gnu>

	* create.c (dump_file): Remove typo in msg.

1989-12-02  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* main.c: Change +copy-pass option to +pass, +copy-in to +in,
	+copy-out to +out, and +mkdir to +make-directories, and add null
	option to terminate table.
	(process_args): Use the same code to handle long and short named
	options.
	(usage): Mention long options in message.

1989-12-01  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@trix>

	* Makefile: Remove comments referring to certain systems lacking
	getopt, since it is now provided always and needed by all systems.

	* port.c: Remove copy of getopt.c, as it is now linked in
	separately to always get the current version.

	* tar.c: Rename +cat-tars option to +catenate or +concatenate,
	and +local-filesystem to +one-file-system (preferred by rms
	and used in GNU cp for the same purpose).
	(describe): Reflect changes.

1989-11-28  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* port.c: Move declaration of alloca into #else /* sparc */
	so it will compile on sparcs.

1989-11-27  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (options): Remove -version option (replaced by +version).
	(describe): Mention long options.

1989-11-25  David J. MacKenzie  <djm@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* getoldopt.c (getoldopt): Make `opt_index' argument a pointer to
	an int, not char.

	* tar.c: Modify long options per rms's suggestions:
	Make preserve-permissions an alias for same-permissions.
	Make preserve-order an alias for same-order.
	Define preserve to mean both of those combined.
	Make old an alias for old-archive.
	Make portability an alias for old-archive, also.
	Rename sym-links to dereference.
	Rename gnudump to incremental.
	Rename filename to file.
	Make compare an alias for diff.  Leave diff but prefer compare.
	Rename blocking-factor to block-size.
	Rename chdir to directory.
	Make uncompress an alias for compress.
	Rename confirm to interactive.
	Make get an alias for extract.
	Rename volume-header to volume.

	Also make +version an alias for -version.

	(options): Shorten code that interprets long options by using
	the equivalent short options' code.  This also makes it tons
	easier to change the long options.

	(describe): Make usage message more internally consistent
	stylistically.

1989-11-20  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* list.c (read_and): Call check_exclude() to see if the files
	should be skipped on extract or list.

1989-11-09  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@hobbes.ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c (fl_read): Fix typos in error message
	"tar EOF not on block boundary".

1989-10-23  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (long_options[]): Add an option for blocked compression.

1989-10-19  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* buffer.c (writeerror): Print a more useful error msg.

1989-09-27  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (main): Mention "tar -help" if the luser types a non-workable
	set of options.

1989-09-11  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (options): Have -F correctly set info_script.

1989-08-29  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* Makefile  Include ChangeLog in tar.tar and tar.tar.Z

1989-08-28  Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* tar.c (options) Made -F imply -M.
	Also remind tar that the -f option takes an argument!

	* Modified -F option to make it do what (I think) it
	should.  e.g, if you say -F, tar won't send a msg to
	msg_file and wait for a <return> It'll just run the program
	it was given, and when the prog returns, the new tape had
	*better* be ready...

	* buffer.c (open_archive): Give error message and abort if
	the luser didn't give an archive name.

1989-08-25  Joy Kendall  <jak@hobbes>

	* Added code to make a new option to run a specified script at
	the end of each tape in a multi-volume backup.	Changed: tar.c:
	made new switch, -F, and new long-named option, "info-script".
	Code is where you would expect.
	* tar.h: added flag f_run_script_at_end, and an extern char *
	called info_script, which optarg gets set to.
	* buffer.c (new_volume): if f_run_script_at_end is set, we give
	info_script to system(), otherwise we do what we've always done.

1989-08-24  Joy Kendall  <jak@spiff>

	[These changes made over the course of 1989-06 -- 1989-08]

	* diffarch.c: diff_archive: Added switches for LF_SPARSE in the
	case statements that needed it.  Also, skip any extended headers
	if we need to when we skip over a file.  (need to change the bit
	about, if the size doesn't agree AND the file is NOT sparse,
	then there's a discrepancy, because I added another field to
	the header which should be able to deal with the sizes): If
	the file is sparse, call the added routine "diff_sparse_files"
	to compare.  Also added routine "fill_in_sparse_array".

	* extract.c: extract_archive: added the switch LF_SPARSE to the
	case statement as needed, and code to treat the sparse file.
	At label "again_file", modified opening the file to see if we
	should have O_APPEND be one of the modes.  Added code at label
	"extract_file" to call the new routine "extract_sparse_file"
	when we have an LF_SPARSE flag.

	Note: really should erase the commented-out code in there,
	because it's confusing.

	* update.c: made sure that if a file needed to be "skipped"
	over, it would check to see if the linkflag was sparse, and if
	so, would then make sure to skip over any "extended headers"
	that might come after the header itself.  Do so by calling
	"skip_extended_headers".

	* create.c: create_archive: added code to detect a sparse file
	when in the long case statement.  Added ways to detect extended
	headers, and label "extend" (ack! should get rid of that, is
	atrocious).  Call the new routine "finish_sparse_file" if the
	linkflag is LF_SPARSE to write the info to the tape.  Also added
	routines "init_sparsearray", "deal_with_sparse", "clear_buffer",
	"where_is_data", "zero_record", and "find_new_file_size".

	* tar.h: Added the #define's SPARSE_EXT_HDR and SPARSE_IN_HDR.
	Added the struct sparse and the struct sp_array.  Added the
	linkflag LF_SPARSE. Changed the tar header in several ways:
	- added an array of struct sparse's SPARSE_IN_HDR long
	- added a char flag isextended
	- added a char string realsize to store the true size of a sparse file
	Added another choice to the union record called a struct
	extended_header, which is an array of 21 struct sparse's and a
	char isextended flag.  Added flag f_sparse_file to list of flags.

	* tar.c: added long-named options to make tar compatible with
	getopt_long, changed Makefile.

1989-03-03  David MacKenzie  <edf@rocky2.rockefeller.edu>

	* buffer.c [USG]: ifdef'd out #include <sys/file.h>.
	(close_archive): SysV doesn't have ftruncate, so substituted
	fmtwrite (just copied the code for MS-DOS).
	* create.c: Unos lacks <sys/sysmacros.h> so provided a substitute.
	(start_header): Only strip leading paths if f_relative_paths is true.
	* extract.c:
	(extract_archive): Only strip leading paths if
	f_relative_paths is true.  Because the Unos filesystem has
	only one timestamp, moved the utime call to after the chown
	and chmod calls.
	* getdate.y: Don't define ftime if Unos.
	* list.c: Defined size_t for Unos.  [USG]: Don't include <sys/file.h>.
	Define <sys/sysmacros> stuff manually for Unos.
	(decode_header): Add braces around switch cases; some compilers
	require them.
	(print_header): Changed UGSWIDTH from 11 to 25 because the smaller
	value made tape listings of files owned by more than one user
	gradually get wider, making them hard to read.
	* port.c: Don't include <sys/file.h> if SysV.  Define
	size_t for Unos.
	(mkdir): Add code to support Unos makedir sys call.
	(getopt): Use malloc instead of alloca, because tar doesn't
	use alloca anywhere else and many systems lack it.  A few other
	changes from the current version of getopt.c incorporated.
	* rtape_lib.c: Undefine RMTIOCTL.  Doesn't seem to be needed,
	and can't compile on Unos/SysV with it defined.  Might need to be
	ifdef'd.
	* tar.c: Alias addname to add_name and rmdir to deldir on Unos
	due to C library weirdness.
	(options): Recognize new -P option to set f_relative paths.
	(describe): Clean up error message and add -P description.
	* tar.h: Add variable, f_relative_paths, to cause tar to strip
	leading `/' characters in pathnames during create and extract.
	* tar.texinfo: Fixed a couple of typos, detected by texi2roff.
	* update.c: Simulate <sys/sysmacros.h> for Unos.

1989-12-12   Jay Fenlason  <hack@ai.mit.edu>

	* New version to go on beta tape with GCC 1.35.
	* Better USG support.
	* Support for __builtin_alloca if we're compiling with GCC.
	* diffarch.c: Include the correct header files so MTIOCTOP
	is defined.
	* tar.c:  Don't print the verbose list of options unless
	given -help.  The list of options is *way* too long.

	* Version 1.06.
	* [__STDC__]: Use STDC_MSG.
	* ENXIO meand end-of-volume in archive (for the UNIX PC)
	* extract.c: Added break after volume-header case.
	* rtape_lib.c: Added patch.  Reported by Arnold Robbins.
	* Added f_absolute_paths option.
	* Deleted refereces to UN*X manual sections (dump(8), etc).
	* Fixed to not core-dump on illegal options.
	* Modified msg_perror to call perror("") instead of perror(0)
	* Patch so -X - works
	* tar.c: Fix so 'tar cf - -C dir' doesn't core-dump.
	* tar.c (name_match): Fixed to chdir() to the appropriate
	directory if the matching name's change_dir is set.  This makes
	tar xv -C foo {files} work.

	* Version 1.05.
	* A fix to make confirm() work when the archive is on stdin; include
	'extern FILE *msg_file;' in pr_mkdir().
	* tar.h [__STDC__]: Fix to work.
	* port.c: New mkdir() ftruncate().  Removed: lstat().
	* Fixed -G to work with -X
	* tar.texinfo: Another fix.
	* tar.c: Changed to say argv[0]":you must specify exactly ...".
	* buffer.c: modified child_open() to keep tar from hanging when
	it is done reading/writing a compressed archive.
	* Added fflush(msg_file) before printing error messages.
	* create.c: fixed to make link_names non-absolute.

	* Version 1.04.
	* Added functions msg() and msg_perror(), modified all the files
	to call them.  Also checked that all (I hope) calls to
	msg_perror() have a valid errno value.
	* Modified anno() to leave errno alone, etc.
	* Re-fixed the -X option.  This time for sure...
	* Re-modified the msg stuff.
	* Flushed anno() completely.
	* Modified the directory stuff so it should work on sysV boxes
	* getdate.y: Added ftime().
	* Fixed un_quote_string() so it won't wedge on \".  Also fixed
	\ddd (like \123, etc).
	* tar.texinfo: More fixes.

	* Version 1.03.
	* buffer.c: Fix so 'tar tzf NON_EXISTENT_FILE' returns an error
	message instead of hanging forever.
	* tar.texinfo: More fixes.

	* Version 1.02.
	* tar.c: Fix so 'tar -h' and 'tar -v' don't cause core dump.  Also
	fixed the 'usage' message to be more up-to-date.
	* diffarch.c [!MTIOCTOP]: Fixed so verify should compile.

	* Version 1.01.
	* tar.texinfo: Fixed typoes.
	* Fixed a bug in the #define for rmtcreat().
	* Fixed the -X option to not call realloc() of 0.

	* Version 1.00.
	* version.c: New file.  -version option added.
	* Installed new version of the remote-tape library.
	* Added -help option.
